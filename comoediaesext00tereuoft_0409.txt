complerint, wherein we see the lover brought to the very brink of
despair; for it was necessary to carry the mistake as far as possible,
before he should be undeceived. We are to suppose his words too
accompanied with gestures equally expressive of his grief, till Syrus,
approaching nearer, perceiving the error, clears Antiphila of those
unjust suspicions, by the long and elegant account of her which follows.

baseness of these wretches‚ should have so often counselled and admo-
nished me in vain, nor could ever prevail with me to break from her;
which, however, I am now resolved to do, though I would not at that
time, when it might have effectually gained me the old man’s heart.’'
Thus Westerhovius interprets the word gratum, citing Phaedrus, i. 22.
