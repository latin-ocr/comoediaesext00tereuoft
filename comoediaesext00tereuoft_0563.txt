cited by Donatus, and to be found in Non. Marcell. The passage is
this: Cum primo cibo et potione initiarent pueros, sacrificabant ,- ab edu-
libus Eduliae,a potione Poticae‚ διο. “ When children were first weaned from
the breast, and were initiated in the use of more solid food and stronger
drink, sacrifice was offered to Edulia and Potica.’' But Madame
Dacier rejects this, because it was a custom purely Roman. And as
this play has been taken from the Greek, she supposes allusion is made
here to the initiating of children in the grand mysteries of Ceres, which
was commonly done while they were yet very young. —- 16. Causa. l*

ACT I. Scnnn II.

Davus is interrupted by the appearance of Geta, who is seen here
coming out to look for him, and leaving instructions at home, if Davus
should inquire for him after he was gone. When they meet they fall
into conversation, in which the whole mystery of the play is laid open:
the danger that threatened Geta, by the precipitata behaviour of his
master‘s son ; the anxiety of the young man himself, lest, at his father’s
return, his Phanium should be torn from him ; and the distress
Phaedria was in, that he could not come at the possession of the music-
girl. All these are strongly represented 3. the passions of the audience

gradually moved, and the way prepared for the appearance of the other
characters, and the parts they are to act.

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.
