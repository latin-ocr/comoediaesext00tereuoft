48. Quem ipse neglexit pater, διο. “ Ι educate a child, whom his own
father has abandoned!” Donatus on this passage takes notice of a
reading which entirely changes the sense, quem ipsa neglexit, pater ;
“ Shall I, father, take care of a child, whom the mother herself has
abandoned? ” But the other reading is certainly the best. It is full
of passion, and is strongly descriptive of the situation of Pamphilus.
There is indeed an objection that may be offered, from a supposition
that this were betraying Philumena. But we are to imagine it a start
of passion, and that Laches, totally ignorant of the secret, catches at
the last words ego alam ? “ I educate him! ” which the actor might
deliver with greater energy than the preceding. -49. Quid dixti 5²
