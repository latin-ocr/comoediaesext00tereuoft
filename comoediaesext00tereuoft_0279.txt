ACT Ι. Seme Π.

Davus here comes upon the stage, and not observing his master,
holds a discourse with himself. His character is that of a sly‚ cunning
slave, wholly devoted to Pamphilus, and trusted by him in the manage-
ment of his private correspondence with Glycerium. His first appear-
ance here is quite agreeable to this notion. He wonders at the lenity
of the old man, and suspects that there is some fallacy at bottom.

. His concern for Pamphilus makes him anxious, if possible, to find it
out, that he may be able to counterplot him.

The first three verses of this scene are Trimeter Iambics‚ and in
some editions joined to the foregoing scene. Verse 5 is Dimeter
Iambic. Verses 7 and 8 are Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic. The
remainder Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic.
