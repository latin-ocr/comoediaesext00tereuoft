ACT IV. Scmvn V.

The two old men again appear with the money 3 upon which Antipho
retires. As they both suspected Phormio to bea mere sharper, Chremes
had been requesting Demipho not to be rash in parting with the money,

pretences, as soon as Phaedria could procure it from his friends, as we
learn from a former scene. —4. Dum libido, διο. “ While the same
