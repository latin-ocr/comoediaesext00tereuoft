“ The ancient Drama was indeed, as a spectacle‚ extremely differen
from the modern3 and, on the stage, approaching nearer to the geniu
of our Opera, than Tragedy or Comedy3 which circumstance, if dul:
considered, might have prevented a deal of idle disputation concerning
the propriety ofa Chorus. The ancient plays, it is certain, were al
accompanied with music. Aristotle mentions music as one of the si:
parts of Tragedy3 and we know from Horace, that the alterations i]
the drama, music and decorations, kept pace with each other; an«
that in process of time, as the Roman theatres were enlarged, thei
music also became more rich and full.

‘ Nor was the fiute at first with silver bound,
Nor rival'd emulous the trumpet's sound:
Few were its notes, its form was simply plain;
Yet not unuseful was its feeble strain
To aid the Chorus, and their songs to raise 3
Filling the little theatre with ease:

To which a thin and pious audience came,
Of frugal manners, and unsullied fame. ·

But when victorious Rome enlarged her state,
And broader walls enclos’d th' imperial seat, ·

Then poesy in looser numbers mov’d,

And music in licentious tones improv'd:
Such ever is the taste when elown and wit,
Rustic and critic, fill the crowded pit.

He who before with modest art had play’d,
Now call’d in wanton movements to his aid,
Fill‘d with luxurious tones the pleasing strain,
And drew along the stage a length of train:
And thus the lyre, once awfully severe,
Increas‘d the strings‚ and sweeter charm’d the ear ;
Thus poetry precipitately fiow’d,

And with unwonted elocution glow'd3
Pour’d forth prophetie truth in awful strain,
Dark as the language of the Delphic fenest—Fuimus.

obscure a part of learning many doubts must necessarily have arinen
but the most probable opinion seems to be, that the flute was employe⁴
to accompany the declamation or recitative, and the lyre was peculia
to the chorus: whence it happens, that in the plays of Termes-:a
