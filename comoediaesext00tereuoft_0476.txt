this fellow !’' Comp. Phorm. iv. 4. 83 Plaut. Asin. i. l. 107. -19.
Ehem Ι [Syrus overhearing.] —- 20. V ostram nequeo mirari satis rationem.
“ Ι cannot sufficiently admire your conduct.” Comp. Eun. iii. 4⁸.- 9.
By mirari here Demea meant “ to abhor’' and “ censure.” Vestram
refers not only to Syrus, but also to AEschinus and Micio. By ratio-
nem, is meant “ infamous conduct.'' Comp. v. 3. 26. Some interpret
it “ calculation.'' Comp. ii. 1. 54. —21. Ne dicam dolo. “To speak
the truth.” Atque is divided, in scanning, between this and the follow-
ing verse.

22. Pisces, διο. [Syrus having delivered the former part qs his speech
in a careless manner, now turns and addresses the servants within] It is
diverting here to observe how Syrus divides his discourse between
Demea and those to whom he had given the fish in charge. This was
making pretty free with his master’s brother. The rogue knew that
Demea was little regarded by his master’s family, and that makes him
the more presuming. The poet, too, has so contrived it as to raiae
Demea’s astonishment still more, and fill him with reflections of the
approaching ruin that threatened his brother’s family. —- 23. Congrum.
Conger, or congrus, was a kind of overgrown eel. It was in great‘esteem
with the gourmands of antiquity, and was generally brought alive from
Sicyon—Ludere. This is properly applied to the continual movement
of fishes in water. Comp. Cic. Frag. Poem. 3283 Ovid, Met. iv. 685:
and see Servius on Virg. AEn. viii. 632. -— 25. Prius nolo. This is said to
show his authority. —Haeccine flagitia ,⁹ “ Are crimes like these
?'’ Aposiopesis. —26. Et clamo saepe. “ And I often cry shame
upon them.'' —- Salsamenta. [Here he again turns and addresses the
servants] —27. Macerentur. It was usual to soak salt fish in water, in
order to abstract a portion of the salt. Comp. Andr. iv. 2. 2.-—28.
Utrum studione. By tmesis, for utrumne studio. Comp. iv. 5. 28. —-
29. Gnatum. He does not say whose son. AEsehinus, however, is
meant. Comp. i. 1. 36. —30. Videre videor. This elegant mode of
expression has been copied by Cicero, ad Div. xvi. 213 Catil. iv. 63 and
by Horace, Od. ii. 1. 21. — 31. Prqfugiet, διο. Comp. Heaut. i. 165.
—-— 32. Quod ante pedes ’st ‘⁴ That which is before one’s eyes ;'' “ the
present.” This is taken from the Greek, Βλέπειν τὸ κείμενον ἐν τοῖς
ποσίνι Stob. Serm. 89. Τὰ ἐν ποσὶν ἶδεῖνε Diog. Laert. Thczl. 34.
Comp. Pindar, Isth. viii. 26 ; Cic. de Orat. iii. 40 ς ad Diu. ii. 133 -

v. 3. 18 ; Cic. ad Dz'v. xiv. 4.- Ut est dementia. “ Such is their mad—
ness.'' —38. Nimium inter vos, διο. “ There is a deal of differenee, a
mighty difference between you; nor is it because you are present that
I say this.'' ——- 39. Ades praesens. Comp. Plaut. Amph. iii. 3. 23 ‚² Cic.
Offi i. 4; Taso. Quaest. iv. 7. — 40. Quantus quantas. “ All over-’⁸
Colman renders it “from top to toe.’' — Nil nisi sapientia. “All
wisdom itself.” So πᾶς ’γὰρ μέτωπόν εἰμι, AElian. V. H. vii. 6 ς and
totus nasus in Catull. xiii. 14. ——4L Ille, somnium. “He is a mere
dotard.” For this, Petronius writes phantasia, c. 38.—-Iumn tuum
Ctesipho. -42. Facere haec ? Comp. i. 2. 27. -Aat non sex totis men-
sibus, &c. “ Or should I not have smelt him out six entire months,
before he attempted any such project ?'' The oet has purposely con-
trived in this scene, to make Demea appear in e most ridiculous light
