some editors, not understanding, have altered to alla. Comp. Virg.
AEn. v. 457.

13. Nihil est, quod, &c. Comp. Hec. v. 2. 28.-- 15. Satis mi id
habeam supplici, dum, διο. “ Ι would consider it sufficient punish-
ment, if I could take vengeance on them in this manner.” All the
ancient edd. as well as the MSS. have dum illos ulciscar modo ,- which is
generally explained thus : “ I would think their punishment sufficient,
could Ι but take what revenge upon them I pleased.” Madame Dacier
and others say: “ I would be content to incur any punishment, to
obtain but a full revenge.'’ Bentley first observed the defect ofsynaloepha
between dum and illos, which is contrary to the custom of Terence.
Hermann, (Elem. D. M. p. 116, Glasg. 1817‚) to remedy this, inserted
ego. The insertion of hoe renders it complete: Hoc modo, “in the
following manner;'' i. e. Seni animam primam, &c. Comp. Andr. v.
3. 32; Eun. v. 3. 11. - 16. Seni. Demea is meant; though the vetus
Interpres of Perlet refers this to Micio. Patrick thinks it may be under-
stood of either, because producere signifies as well “ to educate‚” as “ to
beget.” It will, however, have a better effect, if we apply it to Demea.
Geta, in the heat of his passion, talks at random‚ without regard to nice
discriminating circumstances. How much soever Demea might disap-
prove of his son’s behaviour, Geta, in his present fury, thinks it crime
enough that he begot him. ·-— Animam. “ Life,” as in Lactant. iii. 11.
—Extinguerem. A metaphor from quenching a lamp, or a ᾗτε.-
Produoeit. For genuit or procreavit. — 17. Syrum impulsorem. Comp.
Eun. v. 5. 18.—-18. Sublimem medium. Comp. Andr. v. 2. 20.-
C‘apite pronam in terram. The first two words are put for praecipitem ‚-
and, joined with statuerem, have the signification of praecipitarem: “ 1
would dash him head-foremost to the ground.'' Comp. Cat. xvii. 9;
Virg. AEn. i. 115,— 19. Cerebro dispergat viam. We may say either
viam cerebro dispergere, or cerebrum via dispergere. Both forms occur
in Virgil: the former, ΕΟΖ. v. 40; the latter, AEn. iv. 512. Dispergat
for dispergeret. — 20. Praecz'pz'tem darem. Comp. vs. 18. —- 21. Ruerem,
agerem, raperem, διο. All these are terms borrowed from the art of
war, and aptly chosen to suit Geta’s present temper, who, in the heat
of his rage, thinks himself irresistibly strong. Raerem in an active sense
here: “ I would dash prostrate.'' Comp. Virg. AEn. xii. 4543 Val.
Flac. iii. 102 ς and see Lambinus on Lucr. i. 273, and Heinsius on Virg.
AEn. viii. 63. Westerhovius remarks the frequent recurrence of the
letter R in this verse. The similar endings of all the words are also
remarkable. Comp. Eun. ii. 3. 82.—22. Her-am hoc malo impertiri.
“ To acquaint my mistress with this missortune.”

23. Quisquis es, &c. Madame Dacier observes upon this place,
that in Greece, the people often took a pleasure in stopping and
detaining servants in the streets, that they might be lashed when they
got home, for staying out so long. —- Ego sum Sostrata. Comp. Andr.
v. 6. 1. ¹ The commentators ask, How did it happen, that Geta did not
see the person who called him? Donatus thinks he was prevented
by excessive anger. Westerhovius supposes that Sostrata seized him
behind by the tunic. — Ubinam es Ρ [Geta turns about.]--24. Oppido.
For valde. Comp. Heaut. iv. 2. 2.—25. Quid festinas. Festinare is
said properly of those who are disturbem properare of those who are
upon business. Comp. Eun. iv. 3. 8. —26. Animam recipe. “Take
breath.'’ Comp.Heaut. ii. 2. 12; Phorm. v. 6. 28, and seeValeken. on
