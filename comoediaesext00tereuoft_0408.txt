when he hears that Bacchis is come, he isin great surprise, and not
satisfied with Syrus’s project, who only revealed it to him in part. Ee
is at first greatly enraged, but at last submits, and gives himself wholly
up to the management os Syrus.

l. Ain’ tu? The scene begins somewhat abruptly, and introduces
Syrus and Dromo as continuing a conversation which had been already
begun. We may naturally enough suppose that Dromo had been tell-
ing Syrus some of the adventures that had befallen his master and
himself, during their stay in Asia3 and as several surprising accidents
might have happened in that time, hence at the relation of some of
them, Syrus asks, with an air of surprise, “ Say you so ?” — Dum ser-
mones coedimus. “ While we are chatting together.” This is borrowed

ἕ from the Greek κόπτειν λόγους. Priscian (xviii. p. 217, ed. Krehl.)
cites κόπτειν τὰ ῥήματα, referring to this passage of Terence. Some
think the correct reading here should be sermones serimus, as in Virg.
AEn. vi. 160. Multa inter sese vario sermone serebant. —2. Illae sunt
relictae. ‘⁴ The girls are left behind,’' meaning Antiphila and Bacchis.
—— Mulier tibi adest. [Clitipho listening.] “ Your mistress is present.”
— 4. Minime mirum. In reply to what Dromo had said, illae sant relictoe.
‘⁴ There is no wonder that they should be left behind, they bring such
a troop of women with them.'' Comp. Andr. iii. 5. 11. -5. Perii!
ande illi sant ancillae? “Confusionl whence should she have these
waiting-women 'l’' The poet here artfully introduces Clinia as hastily
taking up a wrong notion of his mistress, and applying to Antiphila
w-hat regarded Bacchis; for all this attendance and apparatus of orna-
ments belonged to the latter. By this he has an opportunity of setting
before us, in a yet stronger light, his fears, suspicions, and distraction
of mind; all which gives the reader a very natural picture of a man
deeply in love: moreover, it makes way for that beautiful description,
which comes in afterwards, of the manner of Antiphila’s employment
during her lover’s absence. —6. Non oportuit renatas. [To Dromo.
“ They ought not to have been left.’' — Hei mihi! [Clinia listcning.
-—- 7. Aurum, vestem. [Syrus continues to address Dromo .·] “They
bring a world of baggage! Gold, clothes! and besides it grows late.”
Syrus seems to say all this by chance, and without design, but the poet
artfully turns them to augment Clinia's fears and suspicions. -8,
Abi dum. The particle dum is redundant. — 9. Quid stas? [Exit
Droma] Comp. Hec. v. 3. 16. -— Quanta de spe decidi! “ From what
a height of hope have I fallen !'’ Comp. Sueton. oth. c. 5 ς Livy,
xxxvii. 26 ; Cic. ad Div. v. 5. — 10. Qaae res le solicitat autem ? The
particle autem, in interrogations, is expressive of indignation. Comp.
Eun. iii. 2. 22; iv· 7. 28.-11. Ancillas, aarum, &c. Constr. Unde
censes esse ancillas, aarum, vestem Antiplaeilae, quam, διο. -- 12. Vah!
nunc demum intelligo. The poet protracts this error of Clinia; nor does
even Clitipho here endeavour to abate his friend's distress‚ as had been
all along his study. Comp. ii. 2. 8. But here he seems rather to yield
to the arguments, by which Clinia is persuaded, that his mistress must
have been seduced during his absence: and this is the more diverting
in Clitipho, because he does not in the least suspect that it is his own
