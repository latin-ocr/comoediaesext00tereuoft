There is a particular emphasis upon eho here. It shows Laches advanc-

ACT ΙΙ. Serum III.

Phidippus and Laches retire, leaving Sostrata on the stage by her-
self, who complains of her hard fate; to be thus unjustly accused with-
out a prospect of being able to vindicate herself. Her husband is so
possessed with the notion, that all mothers-in-law have an inveterate
hatred to their daughters-in-law‚ that it is in vain to expect he will '
hearken to reason 3 and Philumena herself avoids her so industfiously,
and speaks so mysteriously‚ that there is no likelihood of effecting any
thing by her means. She has no other solace, therefore, but the reflec- ’
tion of her own innocence‚ and the hope that, at her son’s return, all
will be cleared up and set right.

This scene consists of Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic.
