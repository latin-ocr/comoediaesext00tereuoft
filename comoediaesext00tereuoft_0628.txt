in writing soliloquies t but the fact is directly opposite in the soliloquy
now before us. The plot proceeds; and the action is carried on· by
the worst method possible, that of converting one of the personagee
into a kind of chorus, interpreting between the poet and the audience,
like Hamlet to Ophelia. The agitation of Pamphilus also is very
different from that of Othello. It does not consist, as it ought in
nature to have done, merely of deliberation and passion 3 but he enters
into a minute detail, and repeats methodically every circumstance
supposed to have passed within. How much more dramatic would it
have been, to have had his better reflections interrupted by the inter-
vention of Myrrhina; which would have given the poet an opportunity
of throwing that narrative part of the soliloquy into an affecting
scene! I cannot help thinking, that the tedious length of this ill-
timed soliloquy‚ together with the want of vivacity in the first and last
acts, was the chief reason of the low reputation of this piece among
the critics of antiquity.'’—COLMAN.

Very well: courage! Go on—huddle strange circumstances one upon
another: with all my heart. Your fable will be wonderful, I allow.
But do not forget, that you must redeem all this marvellous in your
plot, by a multitude of common incidents that atone sor it, and give it
an air of probability.'’—-D1DEROT.

“ The above extract from Mons. Diderot’s Essay on Dramatic Poetry
is a very elegant compliment to the genius of our poet, and the art
displayed in the play before us. The outline of the fable is undoubt-
edly beautiful; but on the whole, I cannot think that outline ‚so
well filled as might be expected from the master hand of Terence.
There are many circumstances happily contrived to create an agreeable
perplexity3 but in other parts of the piece there prevails an uncom-
mon coldness and want of spirit. The same ingenious F rench critic
has a very fine passage in the Essay above mentioned. ‘Although,'

says he, ‘the quickness of the movement varies according to the j

different species of the drama, yet the action always proceeds. It
does not stop even between the acts. ’Tis a mass loosened from the
top of a rock: its velocity increases in proportion to its descent, and
it bounds from place to place according to the obstacles which it meets
within its way.'—According to this comparison, which is, I think, as just
as it is beautiful, what shall we say to the first act of this comedy?
Instead of a mass falling from a rock, it seems an unwieldy masc
which can with difficulty be heaved from the ground: or, to change
the allusion, the poet treats his fable as the Savoyards do a clock-work
figure, which they are obliged to wind up before they can set it iu
motion.-And then, of what does the last act consist? All the ⁴lua.-
t'erials which should compose it, are exhausted in the interval ‚supposed
