tion of the first scene of the Perinthian of Menander, in which the old
man discoursed with his wife, just as Simo does with Sosia. In the
Andrian of Menander, the old man opened with a soliloquy. Menander’s
play, The Perinthiam took its name from the principal female cha-
racter, who was a native of Perinthus, in Thrace. — 11. Non ita, διο.
The order of construction is this, ita non sunt, διο. “ So they are not
different in argument.” - Attamen. The particle quidem, to correspond
with* this clause, is omitted in the former: ‘⁶ They differ, however, in
sentiment and style.” Others take ita in its more usual sense ε “ They
are not so dissimilar in their argument, as in their sentiment;’' or
“ They are not so very dissimilar in argument ; but yet,” &c. Ruhnken
also takes ita here in the sense of valde or admodum. Comp. Livy, iv.
1³2. In place of attamen, the old reading was sed tamen, which made a
syllable too much in the fifth foot. Bentley proposed et tamen, but

without authority. For attamen we are indebted to Hermann. - 12. x

Oratione ac stylo. By the former we are to understand the sentiments,
by the latter the language and composition. Comp. Phorm. Prol. 5.
13. Quae convenere. Terence admits that he transferred into the
Andr-ian from the Perinthian, what he found there suitable to his design.
See note on vs. 9. —- 15. Isti vituperant. “ They slanderously blame.’¹
The pronoun iste is usually employed in contempt. Comp. vs. 21. Ean.
i. 2. 112. See Ovid, Met. xiii. where Ajax frequently uses it in speak-
ing of Ulysses. Ille is often used in praise. See Drakenb. on Sil. Ital.

iii. 181. -—- In eo disputant. “They maintain iu learned disputations on ·

the substet, that comedies should not be jumbled together.'' Disputare,
with the ancient Romans, did not mean “to dispute‚” but “to make
long speeches and dissertations.'’ They usually said disputare rem, de
re, or ad rem ,· very rarely in re. See Cic. Tusc. Qu. iii. 9. Lactant. vi.

22. and Graev. on Cic. Off. iii. 3.- 16. Contaminari, from the ancient verb “· ’
tago for tango, originally signified ‘⁵ Ι handle,'’ “ join,'' “ mix‚’' ‘⁴ jum- 3
ble.’' Hence, ‘⁶ 1 spoil‚” “pollute‚'' &c. Comp. Heaat. Prol. 17 ; and }
see Burmann on Phaedr. iii. 11. 53 and Gesner, Commeat. Acad. Gotting. χι

tom. iii. 252¹- 17. Faciant me intelligendo. Nee, “verily,” not ne,
as some write, taking it interrogatively ε “ In fact, while they endeav-
our to make a display of their learning, they betray their total ignorance.''
Eugraphius reads ne intelligendo, in the sense ofplarimum intelligendo,
to give greater force to this Oxymoron, or seemingly sels-contradictory
verse. The original from Menander is still extant: Μάταιος ἐστὶ καὶ·
φρονεῖν οὐδὲν φρονεῖν. Terence’s line is thus rendered by Colman:
“Troth all their knowledge is, they nothing knOW.’' A similar oxy—-
moron occurs, Eun. i. 1. 18, ut cam ratione insanias.—18. Noeviwm,

Plautum, Ennium. Terence here defends himself by the example of.

others, who had gone before him, all poets of great name and authority.
These poets are not mentioned here in exact chronological order,
Ennius being older than Plautus. The first author who brought a

regular play on the Roman stage, is said to bavebeen Livius Androni- 1

eus, about the year of Rome 510, and one year before the birth of
Ennius. Five years aster the representation of the first play of Andro·
nicus, Naejvius wrote for the stage. Then followed Ennius, Plautus,
Pacuvius, Caecilius, Porcius Licinius, Terence, and his cotemporary and,
adversary Lucius Lavinius, Accius, Afranius, διο. Of all these, many
of whom were very eminent writers, we have scarcely any remains,

except of Plautus and Terence ε and whatis still more to be lamented,.thc⁴
