He says this as if Chremes had been ashamed to name the portion, as
being small. Calpurnius observes here: Tacemus consilia, reticemus
dolores, obtieemus quorum nos pudet. Comp. Eun. v. 1. 4. — 67. Duo
talenta. Comp. iv.7. 103Andr. v. 4. 47. After Menedemus had demanded
of Chremes what portion he intended for his daughter, the father delibe-
rates for some time, not so much, indeed, about her portion, as the
manner of reforming his son. The other, thinking he was in pain,
lest, intending less than was probably expected, the offer might not be
acceptable, encourages him to name it, whatever it was, since, having
enough of his own, he did not much mind what fortune his daughter-
in·law brought with her. But Chremes undeceives him, by naming
’ the sum he intended, and at the same time opening his resolution with

For it is ridiculous, she says, to fancy that Menedemus says sino, before
he asks whether his resolution was fixed, Itane vis ?—7 5. Paret. “ Let
Clinia haste to call the bride.” —76. Hic. Clitipho. -- Ut liberos est
oequom, dictis confutabitur. Chremes is quite against punishing chil-
dren with stripes; and with reason, for that is treating them like slaves.
Blows are only to correct when remonstrances fail ; besides that
they cheek a free spirit, and are apt to make the temper mean and
servile. See what Micio says on this subject, in the first scene of the
