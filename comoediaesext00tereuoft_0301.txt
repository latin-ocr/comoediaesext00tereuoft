Ac'r 111. SCENE 11. 263

prepares us for an incident which, by another turn of circumstances,
afterwards becomes necessary. — Ut sis sciens. For the more usual
expression, ut scias. -- 30. Opinionem hanc tuam. “This silly suspicion
ofyours.” There is a particular emphasis in the pronoun tuam. Such
possessives are never used except to give force to the sentence.

31. Multa, διο. These words, to afferret simul, vs. 35, are given to
Simo by Lindenbrog. -32. Qui. “From which.” —34. Apparari.
This word has been appropriated to the preparation of splendid enter-
tainments. Comp. Heaut. i. 1. 74; Justin, i. 6. —35. Et puerum nt
qffetret simul. “And to bring an infant with her.’' This was a piece
of roguery very common in Greece‚ where they often deceived old men
by supposititious children. — 36. Nz‘l moventur nuptioe. “The marriage
would not be impeded.'' The preparations for the marriage would in .
no manner be changed. Things are said moveri, which do not remain ¹
firm and fixed. Comp. Cic. Phil. i. 7. But Donatus interprets this
non differuntur nuptiae. Comp. iv. 2. 28. Ruhnken prefers the former
interpretation.

39. Quis igitur? “Who then?’' Simo asks him why he had not
warned Pamphilus of the plot that was formed against him. He had
no good answer to make, for he could not with any face pretend that he
had really done so. He therefore gives it another turn, and amuses the
old man with an insinuation that he had drawn off Pamphilus from
Glycerium. This was doing more than to warn him, and seemed to
include every thing. Nothing can be coneeived more artful and deli-
cate. -40, Quam misere. “How much he doated on her.’' Misere
for valde, or vehementem in which sense it is often used by the com'ic
poets. Comp. Heaut. i. 2. 16; Adelph. iv. l. 6; iv. 5. 33. -- 41. ἶ
Post-remo id mihi ἂα negati: “⁴ In fine, leave that affair to me,” i. e. that ⁸
Ῑ may induce your son to take Philumena as his wife. Donatus says,
‘⁴ that Ι may prevent the child being left at your door.'’ —- 43. Immo abi
intro. “Ay‚ get you in.” Immo is used here ironically. —Para.
[Eoeit Davus]

44. Non impulit me, διο. These are the words of the old man, deliberat·
ing with himself, aster he had despatched Davus. His character of
suspicion and distrust is very happily preserved all along by the poet,
who by the word omnino, lets us see that he was not as yet persuaded of
every thing. -— 45. Atque haud scio, an, διο. “And yet perhaps all he
has told me may be true.” Haud scio, an, here is used to express ξ
doubt. “I know not but‚'’ or “perhaps'' It is sometimes used in ³,
affirmation, as in Cicero, Off. iii. 2. See Duker on Flor. iii. 12. Atque
sor et tamen. So neque is sometimes put for et tamen non. Comp. iii.
5. 2, and 8.—46. Sed parvi pendo. “I am unconcerned.” Comp.
Heaat. iv. 3. 37; Hec. iii. 5. 63. —47. Quod pollicitus'st. Comp. ii.
5. 9. - 48. Orabo gnato uxorem. Supply ut det filiam. Some editions
have orabo.- gnato uoeorem si impetro. ——49. Alias. “At any other
time.‘’ Comp. Sueton. Tib. c. 71. See Acron on Hor. Sat. i. 4. 64;
and Drakenb. on Livy, xxi. 57. This interpretation is approved of by
Ruhnkem yet he prefers reading, with Bentley, Quando alias, &c. The
ancient commentators say alias is put here for alia. —- 50. Nam gnatus,
&a Constr. Nam si gnatus nolit praestare quod pollicitus est, haud
dubium est mihi, quin, διο. - 52. Atque adeo. “And now.'' Comp.
v. 6. 13. - In ipso tempore. “ In the very nick of time.'' Comp. iv. 4.
19. — Eccum. For ecce eum. Comp. iii. 3. 48.
