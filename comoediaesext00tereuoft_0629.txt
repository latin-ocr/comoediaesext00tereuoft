to pass between that act and the fourth3 a fault which dramatic
writers, of inferior genius to Terence, are very apt to fall into. But
surely there cannot be an error more fatal to the catastrophe of a
piece, nor any fault more fatal to the piece itself, than an inanimate
catastrophe: ‘for if,’ as continues Mons. Diderot, ‘the above comss
parison be just—if it be true, that there will be so much less of dis-
course as there is more of action—there ought to be more dialogue

than incident in the former acts, and more incident than dialogue iu
the latter.’ '’——COLMAN.

 

EXCURSUS XII.
anm, v. 4. 40. —Plaudita

“ Terence had recourse to the expedient of double plots. And this, I
suppose, is what gained him the reputation of being the most artificial
writer for the stage. The Hecyra is the only one of his comedies of the
true ancient cast. And we know how it came off in the representation ;

·that ill success, and the simplicity of its conduct, have continued to
draw upon it the same unfavourable treatment from the critics to this
day, who constantly speak of it as much inferior to the rest 3 whereas,
for the genuine beauty of dramatic design, and the observance‚ after
the ancient Greek manner, of the nice dependency and coherence of
the sable, throughout, it is indisputably, to every reader of true taste,
the most masterly and exquisite of the whole collection.'’——Hum>‚
Notes on Horace’s Epistles.

‘⁴ Though I would not attempt to justify the town-critics of the
days of Terence, who passed a sentence of absolute condemnation on

. this comedy‚ yet I cannot think that it failed merely for want of

duplicity of intrigue3 nor that the critics of Horace's time esteemed
Terence the most artificial writer for the stage, only because he com-
bined two stories into one. May we not, at this day, speak of the
uncommon art of Terence in the preparation of his incidents, and
conduct of his fable, without being supposed to imply a particular

· commendation of his double plots 2 and may we not allow the beauty

of design in writing on a single plot3 and yet at the same time dis-
cover so many capital defects in the conduct of a particular piece, as
may reduce it to a much lower standard of merit than that os other
comedies constructed on a less correct model ? Voltaire very
justly observes, in his Letters on our Nation, that the love-episode
τ in Addison’s Cato throws a languor on the whole piece. The theatro
affords a constant evidence of the same fact in Nahum Tate's alteration
of King Lear,· and, to instance rather in comedy‚ the Andria of our
author would be much better without the story of Charinus. Interesting
¹ incidents, however, there must be, or insipidity will ensue3 unless the
attention be diverted from examining the plot, by buffoonery; which
is as vicious in the manners of comedy‚ as pantomime changes in the
sable. Terence, whose taste was abhorrent from ribaldry, has, I think,
in this play, suffered the interest of his piece to languish; and if there
be any just observation in the preceding remarks, there is a lameness,
notwithstanding the simplicity‚ in the conduct of the fable. The first
act, being entirely consumed in narration, is very inartificiaL and,
what is still worse, redundant: the discovery of the main incident is·
