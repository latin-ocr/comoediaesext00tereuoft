to apprehend; for that he has contrived to send Demea into the
country. In this part of the conversation they are introduced here,
and it is continued till they are interrupted by the appearance of the
old gentleman himself. The whole scene gives the description of a
modest youth, unpraetised in the ways of hypocrisy and deceit3 one
who respects and stands in awe of his father, and, therefore, is anxious
to conceal from him any thing that he knows will displease him.

Of this scene verses 1, 9, are Tetrameter Trochaics Acatalectic;
2, 10, Trochiacs Tetrameter Catalectic ς 8, a Dimeter Iambic3 and the
remaining verses, Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic.

1. Apud villam. Comp. Andr. i. 5. 19. — 2. Nunc eum maxume.
“ At the present time especially.’' The particles cum and max-ime are
joined also by Cicero, de Senec. c. 2. —- Operis aliquid facere. Comp.
Eun. ii. 1. 14. — Utinam. This must be joined with velim, vby pleo-
nasm. Some supply apud villam sit after utinam. —- 3. Quod cum
salute ejus fiat. “ So that his health were not the worse for it.” -—- 4.
Triduo hoc perpetuo. “For three continual days to come.'' Comp.
Hee. i. 2. 12. —5. Ita fiat, &c. No one has succeeded better than our
poet, in distinctly marking his characters. Ctesipho speaks here with
reserve, and even with a kind of regard for his father: but the rog-ue
of a slave, whose mind is very different, observes no such restraint,
but roundly wishes the old man might effectually free them from all
apprehensions. However‚ he does not explain himself avowedly before
the son, but hides his meaning under ,an equivocal expression, as if
he meant no more than a longer confinement. This shows the poet's
great insight into life and manners. -— 6. Nimis. This word is re-
dundant. — Misere. Comp. Andr. iii. 2. 40. — Diem perpetuum.
“The live-long day.'’ Comp. ii. 4. 23. - 7. Quia prope. These
words constitute a dactyl, and the last foot of the verse. Comp. Heaut.
iii. 3. 13; Eun. ii. 1. 6: see Hermann, Elem. D..M. p. 115. (Glasg.
1817.) —— 9. Prius nox oppressisset, διο. “ Night would have come upon
him before,’' διο. oppressisset for deprehendisset. Comp. ii. 2. 21;
Cic. de Senec. c. 14. — Reverti iterum. The latter word is redundant.
Comp. i. 1. 46 ; Eun. iv. 2. 6; Plaut. Poen. Prol. 79. Fae‘rnus incor-
rectly interprets this bis reverti, which error has been exposed by
Bentley and Ruhnken. - 10. Illic. “ In the country.'’ — ll. Quem
ego, διο. An anticipation of the words of Demea. — 12. In mentem est.
This is the correct reading, as appears from Aulus Gellius, i. 7. The
same occurs in Plaut. Amphitr. i. 1. 25 ς and Cicero has in potestatem
esse. Comp. Heaut. v. 2. 33; Cato, R. R. 52. 1, and 156. 5; also

14. Hisce opera ut data sit. Supply cogita,- or veniat in mentem. —
Non potest fleri. We must still admire Terence's justness in the
propriety of his characters, and maintaining the uniformity of them
throughout. They are in every thing agreeable to the precept of
Horace (Epist. ad Pis. 126) : Servetur ad imum Qualis ab incepto pro-
cesserit, et sibi constet. Ctesipho had been brought up in the country,
under a rigid father, and is, therefore, a stranger to lying, hypocrisy
and deceit. Menander z Ἀριστόν ἐστι πάντας ἐπίστασθαι καλάς Ἐλευ-
θέρσυ ’γὰρ ἀνδρὸς τ’ ἀληθῆ λέγειν. — 16. Amicis. Comp. Heaut. v. 1. ,
