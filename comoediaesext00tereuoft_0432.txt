if?..1 allude to those who say, What if the sky should fall?” The
common reading 1s Quid si redeo ad illos, διο. Guyetus reads quid εἰ
rideo. Syrus jeeringly repeats the words of Clinia, quidsi? quinia
could not easily be divested of his fears: for it is natural when we have
much at stake to be very solicitous about it. Syrus, impatient ‚at so‘
many delays, and confident too that there is no danger, endeavours to
make them appear ridiculous and absurd3 and for that purpose has
recourse to a proverb which denoted fears the most foolishly grounded,
such as only people ignorant in the highest degree could yield to.

Clinia, at length overcome by the arguments of Syrus, submits to the,
plans of that crafty slave. Comp. ii. 3. 91. — Optume. “ Opportunely.”
Comp. iv. 5. 93 v. 5. 2. This word is, in most editions, separated
from the following words : Optume! “ That¹s excellent!” referring
to what Clinia had just said, Age, age, διο.

 

ACT IV. SCENE IV.

Bacchis had been drawn from town by a promise of ten minae, which
Syrus had made. She, who had as yet heard nothing of the money,
begins to be i1npatient‚and, to rouse them effectually, talks aloud to
her maid Phrygia, in the hearing of Syrus, pretending to give them the
slip. Syrus, in a great sright, begs her to call back the maid, assuring
her that he will procure the money for her instantly; but th’at in the
mean time,-to forward his projeet, it isnecessary for her, and her
whole train, to go over to Menedemus, to which at last, with some diffi-
culty, she yields. ⁷

The metre is Tetrameter Iambic Catalectic.
