that point.'’ Comp. Eun. i. 2. 75. —Multa in homine, διο. Micio is
offering an apology for his own lenity and indulgence, and does it from
this consideration3 that although it might in some cases be dangerous,
yet he had reason, from the disposition and temper of the two youths,
to judge it would be otherwise with them. Were they wholly restrained,
it would be only adding a spur to their desires3 but if a little indulged,
experience would soon convince them of the vanity and folly of these
youthfizl sallies, and then it would be an easy matter to reclaim them.
Madame Dacier observes, that Micio, being hard put to it by the real
circumstances of the case, thinks to consound Demea by a nonsensical
galimatia. Colman dissents from the ingenious lady’s opinion in this
matter: for he thinks a more sensible speech could not be made, nor a
better plea offered in favour of the young men, than that of Micio in
the present instance. — 36. Quibus ex. For ex quibus. —- 37. Duo cum
