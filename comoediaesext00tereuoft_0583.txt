ACT III. Sann Ι.

Antipho, who is naturally of a timorous disposition, and in danger
of betraying himself, by the confusion he is apt to discover, when
questioned about any thing, had, as we have seen, from consciousness
of this, retired at his father's return. Asterwanis, reflecting with him-
self on the ill consequence of this, as he is necessarily obliged to
leave his affairs to the management of others, whom they little con-
cerned, he resolves to shake off this weakness‚ and maintain his own
cause. Accordingly he approaches‚ full of these thoughts, and is
overheard by Geta, who immediately lets him know that they no less
blamed his absence, than he did himself ; but that they had not
been negligent of his interest.

Of this scene verses 1—4, 15, 16, are Tetrameter Trochaics Acata-
lectio ς vss. 5, 6, 17—20‚ Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic. The
remaining verses are Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic.

suspicion of his having acted in concert with Phormio. Much de-

had been owing to the tricks and devices of Phormio, he would not
find it so difficult a matter to pacify him.
