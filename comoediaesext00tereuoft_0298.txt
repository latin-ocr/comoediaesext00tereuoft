ς am undone, I am lost indeed, if this be true.” Actum est is a for-mula ⁴
implying despair, and is transferred from judicial causes. When a·
ξ suit had been terminated, and sentence passed by the judge, the words
ᾗ actum est were pronounced by the crier. After this the sentence could

tandem sensi stolidus. “ F ool that I was, scarce smelt it out at last! ’³
Here, says Donatus, the poet inculcates an excellent moral, and shows
that suspicions persons are as subject to be deceived as those of less
penetration : for by too great acuteness and refinement they misrepre-
sent circumstances, and impose upon themselves. Tandem here is a
particle of indignation. Comp. Eun. v. 2. 68. -—- Quid hic semisse ait?
[Davus‚ listening] “ What's this he says, he has smelt out ?” In this
verse dus quid hie may be considered either as a daetyl or an anapest.

Glycerium.

15. Juno Lucina. [Glycerium from witlam] Diana had the care of
g women in child-birth, under the three several names of June Lucina,
² Ilithyia, and Genitalis. It is for this reason that she is said by the poets
to be thrice invoked. See Adelph. iii. 4. 41; Hor. Od. iii. 22. 3; Garm.
Saee. 14. 15. —— 16. Hui, tam cito? ridiculum. “Hey-day! already?
Oh Ξ ridiculous !’' Cito in this verse is an iambus. The final of this
word is short in every other poet. —- 17. Non sat commode, διο. “ The
incidents of your plot are not skilfully divided nor well-timed.”
Res temporibus dividere means so to distribute incidents, that every
-, thing be transacted in its proper time. A metaphor from the stage,
where times and actions must be so managed, that every thing may
ξ follow in a natural order, and what ought to come in only in the fifth
act, do} not appear in the second and third. Simo, therefore, re-
ἐ proaches Davus, that he had neglected this rule, in making Glycerium ⁴
lie in too speedily, intimating‚ that he suspected the whole to be his
contrivance.

19. Num immemores discipuli? “ What! are your pupils then un-
-mindful of their eueS, and want a prompter 2 ” The pupils are Mysis, ζ
Lesbia, Glycerium, and Pamphilus, by whom Simo supposed the plot q
was being carried on. Davus he supposed the master and contriver- ‘of
it. lt was the duty of a play-writer to teach the performersmnd μ
