which is, besides, a proper introduction to what follows: “ All is now '-
prepared within;” as if he already considered Chremes as the father-in- ν

“ You have taken special care.”

7. Ubi voles, arcesse. “You may now send for the bride when you ·
will.'’ Ubi for quandocumque. —- Id enimvero hinc nunc abest. [Thisis v
said ironically] “ That, to be sure, is all that is wanting now-'³ Abest
for deest, as in Plaut. Stich. v. 4. 29; Epid. i. 1. 25. See Burmann on ἓ
Virg. AEn. viii. 47. —- 8. Etiam tu hoc* responde. “ And will you answer “
me this: What business had you in that house P’ [Pointing to the ’·

i-v. 2. 11. Comp. Petron. c. 21. — Mihin’ ? Davus here, not knowing τ
what to answer‚ endeavours to gain time, partly by repetitions, partly ·
ι by evasive answers. —- 9. Quam dudum. “ How long ago.” —1o. Cum
tuo gnato una. “ I only went in just now with Pamphilus.” The poet
here makes Davus so disconcerted and frightened, that he forgets all
his cunning, and betrays Pamphilus. The fable itself required this, for
the poet now wants to come to the unravelling of the plot. Howevel',
to· preserve in some degree Davus's character of presence of mind,
though he does not dare to speak to his master, he recovers himself
somewhat by turning· suddenly to Chremes, and telling him what he
had heard from Crito the Andriam which, to set off the more artfully,
he does with an air, as if he gave but little credit to it. —- 12. Quid
illum censes ? That is, propter quid censes illum ibi esse ‚⁹ [Sneeringly]
“ Why, for what do you think? Only to scold her a little, to be sure.”
Comp. Adelph. iv. 5. 22.

13. Immo vero, Sec. “ Nay, but you shall hear from me, 1 promise
you, an unwarrantable piece of impudence.” Immo vero denies what
Chremes had asserted: “ Nay, that’s notit, but‚” &a -— 14. Ellam.
For en illum .- “ Ι will describe him.” — Confideus, catus. “ Confident
and shrewd; his look bespeaks him of some consequence.” Confidene
is a word which the grammarians call vox media, a word of double
import‚ sometimes taken in» a good, sometimes in a bad sense. The
Scholiast 011 Hor. Sat. i. 7. 7, explains it thus: confidens iu malis, sed
fidens in bonis. It is to be taken in a favourable sense here.-- 16.
Tristis severitas inest in voltu. “ A grave severity is in his face, and
credit in his wofflsss’ So tristis judex, Cic. Ver. i. 10. Comp. Nepos,
Epam. c. 2. -- 17. Quidnam apportas? Whatever is brought from a·
foreign land is said. apportari. Comp. i. l. 46. —- 19. Verbum si addi-
deris. Aposiopesis. —— 20. Sublimem hunc intro rape. “ Take up this
sellow, and carry him in·- instantly.⁷' This expression was usual when
one was to be hurried awayv with violence, so as not to be suffered to
touch the ground. Comp. Adelph. iii. 2. 18. — Quantum potes. Fot'

23. Ego jam te commotum reddam. ‘⁴ I will presently make you*
tremble.'’ This is said in allusion to Davus’s speech vS. 1. Animo
nunc jam otioso esse impero. — Tamen etsi, δίο. “But though what Ῐ
have now told you should prove true.” To this Simo replies, “ Thougk
it should prove true or false,'’ δια-24. Atque audin’? “And, do
you hear? bind him, hands and feet.’' It was usual with the Atheniens

to put a wooden collar (κύφων) on criminals, sor the purpose of
¹ pressing down their head, and then to bind them, hands and feet, like a
= calf. This punishment was called κυφωνισμός. -27. Et illi, patre-m.
