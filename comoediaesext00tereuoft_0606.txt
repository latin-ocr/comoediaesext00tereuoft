keeps Phanium in his eye3 and expresses himself obscurely in this
place, because the old men were not yet aware of the intelligence he
had received on that head, though every subsequent speech leads
gradually to an explanation, tends to create an open rupture between
him and the old gentlemen‚ and brings on the final discovery to
Nausistrata.
