unlawful love, and to have some support in his old age, prevailed on
him to marry. It happened that this very girl, Philumena, was
selected for him as a wife, to the very great joy of her mother3 who,
as she. alone was conscious of the girl's misfortune, was glad to have
her married as soon as possible, hoping, by this means, to conceal the
disaster. But it fell out far otherwise than she expected; for Pam-
philus, who had with great reluctance consented to marry, because he
found it impossible all at once to shake off his passion for Bacchis,
totally avoided the company of his wife. Bacchis, to whom Pamphilus
had promised that he would not marry during her life, greatly re-
senting the injury which she imagined was done to her, did not behave
to him now with her usual good humour. This provoked Pamphilus,
and gradually weakened his affectionS, so that his passion soon took a
new turn, and he became fond of the wife he had before despised.
Meantime an affair happens, that calls Pamphilus from home. During
his absence, Philumena, sensible of her state, began to avoid all

few days after, Sostrata sends for her, but is answered, that she is
unwell. She goes to see her, and is refused admittance. Laches
hearing this, accuses his wife, and lays all the blame on her. She
clears herself, and endeavours to make it appear that the charge
is without foundation,'as not being conscious of any thing that could
make her company disagreeable to her daughter-in-law. Meantime
Pamphilus returns; and it so chanced, that the very day of his arrival
at Athens, Philumena was brought to bed. When, therefore, im·-
patient to see her, for he understood she was ill, and loving her to
distraction, he had suddenly rushed in, he finds-that she is delivered of
a son. Myrrhina, as he is retiring‚ follows him, and with tears
requests him, as it could in no way injure him to keep this affair
secret, nor was he requested to take back his wife, unless it was his
own choice, that he would not betray her daughter’s misfortune, and
thereby ruin her reputation. He gives his promise. After this, when
he would neither take back his wife, nor assign the true reason of his
refusal, the old men begin to suspect that he was still enslaved to
Bacchis, and for that reason so averse to live with his wife. Laches,
therefore, sending for Bacchis, expostulates with her, but she wholly
clears herself, and the old man further requests of her, that she will go
in to the women, and also ²try to remove their suspicions. Accord-
ingly she goes in with the ring upon her finge‘r, which Pamphilus
had taken from Philumena. By means of this ring it is known that
Pamphilus himself was the father of the child; upon which Pamphilus,

full of joy, takes home his wife and son.
