goddess of health, together with AEsculapius, because in Greece their'
statues were always placed near each other; so that to offer up prayers
to the one, and not to the other, would have been held the highest
indignity to the power neglected.—4·. Iterum. Comp. i. 2. 111.--

8. Nothing is more just than this observation3 for love and esteem
are free, and not to be acquired by importunity and zeal. Itis one of
the wisest maxims in life, where we do not find ourselves agreeable,
never to aim at forcing friendship3 because our endeavours to please
will only serve to heighten the aversion and disgust. — 10. Videre. A

you, I will follow presently.” The behaviour of Pamphilus in this
scene is most faithfully copied from nature. Being shocked at the
discovery he has made, he leaves the house in great anguish, which,
though he wishes to dissemble, he is unable to conceal. He cannot
receive his mother as he ought, or give an answer of above two words:
and feeling himself unfit for conversation or company, he finds means
to remove Sostrata and Parmeno as soon as possible. When any unex-

accusative of the person, as in Andr. i. 3. 4. Comp. Phorm. i. 2. 49.

thing, as if by hypallage, in place of adjuta eos onera portantes·
