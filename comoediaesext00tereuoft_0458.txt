420 ADELPHI.

ACT I. Scmm ΙΙ.

In this scene we are let more particularly into the different cha-
racters of the two brothers. Demea, hearing that AEschinus had
broken into the house of a certain person, and carried off by force a
music-girl, comes to reproach his brother Micio with it. This was
his usual way. For as he knew Micio to be of an easy, indulgent
temper, and that he was not severe in checking those youthful sallies
of his son, he judged that it would be in vain for him to chide the
young man himself, so long as his brother overlooked his follies, and
even granted him whatever he wanted to support them. He therefore
carries his first complaints to Micio, and accuses him as the cause of
all these irregularities. The other endeavours to defend his conduct,
as agreeable to reason and good sense3 which provokes Demea so
much, that they are near coming to a downright quarrel.

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.

l. Ehem Ι opportune. Demea's churlishness and rusticity appear in
his very first address. He neglects his brother's salutation‚ as im·-
patient to vent his spleen against him. -- 2. Quid tristis es? ‘⁶ Why
are you vexed ’ἶ ” Quid for propter quid. — Rogas me, 8το. “ Do you
ask me why I am vexed, when we have such a son as AEschinus‘t'’
Ubi for eum, or quoniam. This is the interpretation of Eugraphius,
and is adopted by most commentators. Madame Dacier think· ubi is
put here for apud quem : ‘⁴ Can you put this question to me, you who
have the guardianship of AEschinus?'’ Reinhardt understands this
passage in the same sense, but considers ubi as put for in eo loco. He
suggests two other explanations : “Do you ask me why I am vexed‚
when AEschinu's is sunk into such a state of depravity?” or, “How
can you ask, διο. when you know in what a situation AEschinus is
placed ⁹'’ Here qui cogitas, or cnm cogites, i. e. scias, is to be supplied.
--3.Ι)ἰ.πιίη’1ιοι·]“ονεῑρ [Aside. ·] “Did I not say this would be the
case. 7⁹ ’.—-4 Quid fecit? “What evil has he done. θ’ — Quem nequa
pudet quiequam. Here we have quicquam in the accusative in place of
the genitive. So Menedemi vicem miseret me, in Heaut. iv. 5. l. But the
accusative of the thing may depend on propter understood. Scheller
thinks quicquamanominative here, and in Plaut. Mil. iii. 1. 30. Comp.

Τὰ πρῶτα-α πάσης τῆς ἀναιδείας ἔχει. —— 7. Modo quid designavit}

“What new prank has he just now committed. '²' Designar'e is a word
taken sometimes in a good, sometimes in a bad sense, and properly
denotes the doing of any thing new or extraordinary. We find that
among the Romans, they who had the care of funeral games, were
called designatores .· probably for this reason, that, in exhibiting them,
they were generally at a great deal of pains to find out things new
and wonderful, such as might both please and surprise the people. ’

8. Fores effregit, διο. Demea endeavours to represent the late attempt
of AEschinus in the worst light, that by making him appear highly
blamabIeLhe may the more irritate his brother against him„ For this
