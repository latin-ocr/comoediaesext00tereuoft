Ac'r v. sanE 111. 409

ACT V. Serme ΙΙΙ.

In this scene the poet very happily paints the tenderness, anxiety,
and concern of a mother for her son, and the morose obstinacy of a
husband, who, persuaded that every thing he does is right, and imagin-
ing himself of superior understanding, despises every thing his wife can
say, as trivial and beneath his notice.

’-Τ11ει·θίε the same objection to this scene as to the former, on account
of the long interval between the soenes.

Verses 2 and 17 are Dimeter Iambics. Verses 11—14‚ 19—21, are
Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic: the remainder of the scene consists
of 'tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic.

hear your idle story over again.” ——- 9. De re tanta. Comp. v. 2. 29.

foundling.'' Subditum sor suppositum. Comp. Juvenal, vi. 601. Itis
odd enough that Madame Dacier changes the text here according to a
conjecture of her father, and reads suspicetur, “he may suspect ;” and
assigns as a reason for it, that Terence could not be guilty of the very
impropriety which she undertook to vindicate in the preceding scene.
I have followed the common reading, because Chremes ordering her to
confirm her son's suspicions, shows that he understood her words in a
positive, not a potential sense. Clitipho, on his entrance in the next
scene, seems to renew a request already made; and it would be a poor
artifice in the poet, and, as Patrick observes, beneath the genius of
Terence, to make Sostrata apprehend that these would be her son’s
suspicions, before she had any reason to suppose so. -—— Sic erit. For ³

16. Quod filia est inventa? There is some difficulty in this place,
says Patrick‚ nor does it appear at first sight, why Sostrata makes this
supposition. The most common explication given by commentators
is this: “ Shall Ι, therefore, easily convince him that he is my son,
because our having so lately found a daughter, is an evident proof that
1 have not been barren ?'’ But this does not at all appear satisfying.
