[Syrus replies .·] “ No, but out of complaisance to yourself, because
upon your going over to him depends the success of my project for

getting the money.” It seems to me, says Colman, that the poet'ss
intention is no more than this: Bacchis expresses some reluctanee to

act under the direction of Syrus, but is at length prevailed on, finding
that he can by those means contrive to pay her the money which he
had promised her.

ACT IV. Scmm V.

In this scene we have the eontinuation and success of Syrus’s pro-
ject. Chremes, agreeably to his character of a good-natured and
friendly man, is here introduced, expressing his concern for his neigh-
bour Menedemus, to whose lot it is now fallen to feel the weight of
this expensive train; and the more so, as he foresees that he is
likely to continue under the burden for some time. While thus
musing, he perceives Syrus, and renews the former conversation about
deceiving Menedemus: to which Syrus gives so artful a turn, as to

persuade him to give with his own hands the money to Clitipho, and
uorder him to carry it to Bacchis.
