covers uncommon judgment in preserving his characters. Menedemus,
when he hears of good news, immediately inquires if they relate -to his
son, thinking nothing else worthy his notice. — 21.· Valet atque vivit.
Comp. Martial, i. 70. 15. — Apud me. “At my house.” —22 Clinia
meas venit? These repetitions in the mouth of Menedemus speak
the justness of the poet’s geniuS, and how well he understood the
language of the passions. There is a passage very like this in Plautus,
Capt. iv. 2. 92. — 24. Tuum conspectam. For this Pliny, Paneg. c. 22,
writes conspectum tui. See Schwartz on that passage. —27. Non tu ei
dixisti, ut essem ,⁹ “Did you not tell him in what plight 1 was? '²

authority, but never quite to give it up; for this is notonly an inJury to

is granted. — 29. Tam vieto animo. ‘⁴ Of so yielding a spirit.” Comp.
i. 1. 62; Virg. AEn. ii. 699. ·

30. Non possum. “ I cannot help it.” Comp. v. 5. 18. -Satz'sjam,
satis. Comp. Andr. v. 1. 1.— 31. Utramque in partem. “You ane
too violent in extremes.'' Here was the time to make Menedemus
sensible of the error he was likely to fall into; and there is this further
remarkable in what Chremes says, that it contains one of the best
maxims for the conduct of life. For too much rigour in a famer, or
too much indulgence, is equally dangerous. Regard ought always tobe
had to the circumstances of things, and the temper of the persone—.—
33. In eandem fraudem. “ Into the same error.”-—Ex hac re. “ From
your present profuseness’' — 35. Commetare. A frequentative sor.

j or silver in melting or working3 that part which in meltingturns into
1 a calx. Hence any “loss ’' or ‘⁴ waste.” Comp. Cic. Verr. iii. 50.

- Ruhnken says, it signifies the “damage ’‘ or “loss'’ occasioned by

the friction or collision of two bodies. -41. Quam ea nunc mmm

were going to enumerate many other sources of extravagance {fin
