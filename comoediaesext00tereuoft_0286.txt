See note on i. 1. 46. -44. Consuetudo. “ Intercourse.'’ This, says
Ruhnken, is referred to serum in the preceding line ; amor to inhuma-

Cort. on Sall. Cat. c. 14.-47. Etiam nunc, διε. Ordo: Illa dicta

— 52. Nec clam te est, quam illi utraeque res nunc utiles, διο. “ Nor are
you ignorant that both of these avail but little‚” διο. The particle quam
set before some affirmative adjectives, is sometimes considered as put

cally, and therefore in meaning is the same as parum utiles. Comp.

⁴⁴ She recommends her to my care.'' Thus Ruhnken, citi-ng Cic. Div.

ing is this speech, than Bevil's dry detail to Humphry' of his meeting
with Indiana! a detail the more needless and inartificial, as it might,

with much more propriety and pathos, have been entirely reserved for
Indiana herself in the scene with her father.

f{here is a palpable imitation of this beautiful speech in the Orphan
o tway :

cmmonm. “ When our dear parents died, tliey died together;
One fate surprised them. and one grave received them.

My father with his dying breath bequeathed

Her to my love: My mother, as she lay

Languishing by him, called me to her side,

Took me in her fainting arms, we pt, and embraced me>;
Then pressed me close, and as she observed my tears,
Kissed them away: Said she, chamont, my son,

By this, and all the love Ι ever showed thee,

Be careful of Monimia; watch her youth ;

Let not her wants betray her to dishonour.

Perhaps kind heaven may raise some friend—then sighed3
Kissed me agaim so blessed us, and expired.”
