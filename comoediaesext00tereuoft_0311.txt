Nihil ad te. “What is that to the purpose2” This is the proper
sense of these words. Pamphilus would have Davus to think of
nothing but what regards himself, and find some expedient- to extricate
him from his present troubles3 whereas he imagines by this that' he
wanted only to gain time. — Inventum dabo. For inveniam. So
effectum dabo, for efficiam, Eun. ii. 1. 6.

 

ACT IV. SCENE ΙΙ.

In this scene Mysis comes out from Glycerium, who, knowing that
this is the day that had been agreed upon for the marriage of
Pamphilus with Philumena, is full of anxiety and impatient to see
him, that she may be satisfied of every thing herself. The sight of
Mysis renews in Pamphilus his tenderness and remembrance of
Glycerium, and produces a solemn promise that no consideration
shall be able to make h-im abandon her. This appearance of Mysis,
and mention of Glycerium to Pamphilus in his present perplexity, is
finely imagined by the poet, that the lover may be roused and con-
firmed in his resolution of adhering to his mistress, notwithstanding
the promise he had made to his father. And because Mysis herself
was scarcely sufficient to bear him up against so pressing a difficulty, it
is so contrived that he is carried to Glycerium herself.

Of this scene vss. 3, 6, 9, are Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic. The
remainder are Tetrameter Iambics Catalectic. In vs. 1, there is a
defece of the synaloepha in the words Jdm abi.

1. Ubi ubi. For ubicumque, as in Livy, ii. 2. So cui cui for cm·-
cumque, Sueton. Claud. c. 17. -- 2. [To Glycerium within] -—— Noli te
macerare. ‘⁶ Forbear to fret yourself.” Thus Ovid, Epist. xx. 125;
Livy, v. 54. Macerare properly signifies ‘⁴ to sosten by steeping,'’ as in
the Adelph. iii. 3. 27. — 3. Mysis. [Pamphilus goes up to hen] — Te
mihi offers. For mihi obvius sis .· “ I have fortunately met with you.”
In ipso tempore ostendis, in the same signification, occurs Hee. iv. 4. 5.-
Mihi in this verse is a long monosyllable, and not elided by the
following vowel. -- 4. Orare jussit. Ordo : Hera jussit me orare te, si
ames se, ut jam venias ad sese. —- 5. Hoc malum. The missortune into
which Davus had plunged him. —Integrascit. “⁴ Is renewed again.''
——6. Siccine. Supply oportet. For the omission of tlie indicative
verb see note on Eun. iii. 5. 5. [He addresses himself to Davus]
‘⁸ Unhappy that we are, through your cursed means, to be tormented
thus! ” Solicitare, from solum and> citare„ properly signifies ‘⁴ to stir
the ground-’⁹ Comp. Tibull. i. 7. 30. Hence “ to disturb,'' or
“disquiet.” Comp. v. 3. 16; Adelph. ἰ. l. 11.—7. Nam idcirco.
[Addressing Charinus] — 8. Quibus quidem, &c. “ From which
nuptials how easily we might have been delivered if he had been
quiet.’⁷ [Charinus here points to Davus]

9. Si hic non insanit, &e. [Addressz‘ng Charinus in bitter irony]
“‘If my master raves not enough of himself, do you irritate him.'’
Although Davus had borne with patience the anger of Pamphilus, yet
he could not endure with the same calmness the behaviour of Charinus,
who, instead of sostening his master, only provoked him the more
against him. He therefore checks him here, to make him sensible.
