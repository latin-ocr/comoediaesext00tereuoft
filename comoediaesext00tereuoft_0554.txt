We are not to wonder that Parmeno appears surprised to see Bacchis
coming out from Pamphilus. He was a stranger to what had 'lately
passed, while he was at the AcropoliS, and, therefore, could not con-
ceive why she should appear at a house, where it might be justly
presumed she was hated.

10. Propere curre ad Pamphilum. Parmeno, as Donatus observes,
is represented as one curious to know every thing, and at the same
time indolent and lazy. Terence, to set off this in the stronger light,
contrives frequently to send him about, and raise his curiosity, without
satisfying it. Comp. iii. 3. 11. — 11. Quid eo? Supplypropter. Comp.

18. Quantam, &c Here the whole plot is unravelled, and every
thing prepared for the happy conclusion of the play. By the manage-
ment of the poet, Bacchis is left alone upon the stage, where she
informs the spectators how she came to make this important discovery,
which removes every obstacle, and reconciles the several disagreeing
parties. — 20. Gnatum ei restituo, &a “ Ι restore a son to Pamphilus, a
son nearly lost by his and these women’s means.” Comp. iii. 3. 403
