-- 15. Si sic estfactum, &c. Colman, who follows this reading, rendere
it: “ Madam, if so, my master gains a loss;'' with this note: The
most indifferent parts of an author commonly give the most trouble.
The sense of the original being somewhat dark, and the best con-
struction not very elegant, several attempts have been made to amend
and alter the text. In this, as in most other cases, I believe the
common reading to be the right one; and that it contains nothing
more than a conceit from a slave, founded on the words damno auem,
which I have endeavoured to render in the manner of the original,
“gains a loss.” Some think by herus is meant Clitipho, others
Chremes. Eugraphius explains the words to signify that Clitipho will
be a loser by a new-found sister, who will be co-heiress; and others
will have them to imply the loss to be sustained by Chremes in paying
Antiphila’s portion. Thus Colman. Acidalius on Paterculus cor-
rected it thus :—Sie est factum .· domina ego, herus damno auctus est.
But Bentley changes domina into minor, and reads: Sic est factum.-
mz’nor ergo herus damno auctus est. By minor herus {is meant Clitipho.
Heinsius read from the Codex Bembinus: Sustu-lz'sti ,⁹ So. Sic est
factum. CH. Domi ne? SY. [auditoribus ridens,] Ergo herus damno
auctus est. This has been adopted by Schmieder.-—17. Insaniam·
“ F olly.’'

22. Exsequi. This signifies “to put in execution'’ any thing eom-
manded. Comp. Livy, iv. 28. — Inter-emtam oportuit. For the
participle after oportet, sec i. 2. 26. One cannot avoid being seized
with a kind of horror, to think that, in a country so polite as Graece,
men should be found so blind, so inhuman, and barbarum, as to

murder their own children, without remorse or trouble, when they v
imagined the interest of their family required it. We have hene aa
husband, who, because his wife did not obey the cruel order, tells her-
she understood neither reason nor equity. And yet philosophy had
