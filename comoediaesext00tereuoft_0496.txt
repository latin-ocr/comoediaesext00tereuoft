ἐνῳ καὶ βαλειν δεῖ, ἃ πρόσφορα καὶ βαλόντα χρῆσθαι καλῶς τοῖς πεσοῦσι.
Alexis, as cited by Stobaeus:

Toto ὸζῇν νὲστὶν νιιῗσπεροὶ ιυκ ’βοι,

Madame Dacier thinks Menander might possibly have borrowed this
moral maxim from a passage in the tenth book of Plato’ 8 6118.-

Κόρδακα ἕλκων, “drawing the cord'’ is a phrase that requires to be
particularly explained. One would be apt 1ο think that 111 111088 times,
when any number of persons danced 111 company, they all held a cord,
and he who was first of the 118111, was said ducere restim. But many
reasons may be offered against this. To what purpose a cord? Could
they not dance hand in hand? This is much more likely, that a oom-
pany dancing' m train, and linked together by the hands, gave rise to the
expression. This notion derives credit from a passage of Livy, where
describing the solemnity of twenty· -seven young virgins, who went
dancing 111 procession to the temple of J uno he has these words (xxvii.
37). In foro pompa constitit, et per manus reste ducta, virginee sonum
vocis pulsu pedum modulantes, incesserunt. Where we are to obserare,
that per manus reste ducta does not signify “ holding with their hands
a cord,'' but “ making a cord of their hands,” i. e. having them linked
together, and lengthening out the procession; for that ,11 was the
custom to dance hand in hand, is evident from Horace. See od. i.
