Att. i. 18; Livy, iv. 353 Tacit. Hist. iii. 32. The first qui is put for
qua ratione.- the other is a nominative to proelum—Age, scis, διο.
“ Well, but do you understand what Ι am going to say ?'' —— 8. In loco.
‘⁴ On a proper occasion.” Thus Livy, ii. 47 3 Spreta in tempore gloria,
interdum cumulatior redit. Comp. v. 3. 41 ; Hor. Od. iv. 12. 28. --
Hui Ι ’ Some give this to Sannio, interrupting and deriding Syrus.
But it reads much better if we suppose it to come from Syrus, who
here makes a sudden pause, as wondering that Sannio did not see, that
by humouring AEschinus for the present, he might beable to make him
his dupe afterwards. — 10. Adulescenti esses morigeratus. ‘⁴ If you had
submitted to the young man.’' Morigerari is the same as morem gerere.
See vs. 6. — ll. Ne non tibi istucfoeneraret. “Lest that would not return
to you with interest.'’ Ne non is put here for ut. Istuc (i. e. de tuo
jure paululum) is the nominative to foeneraret, which is used in a neuter
sense here. Comp. Phorm. iii. 2. 8; and see Schulting on Seneca,
Suas. iii. 57. Sannio had maintained it as his right, that he could not
be forced to sell the music-girl. This is what Syrus refers to here:
You ought not to have insisted so rigorously; but as you found him so
earnest, your best way was to have yielded, which would have been cer-
tain gain to you in the end.

12. Nunquam rem facies· “ You will never make a fortune.'’ Comp.
Andr. i. 5. 53. -Αὺί, non scis, διο. “ Away! You do not know how
to inveigle men.’' A metaphor from bird-catching. Comp. Plaut.
Asin. i. 3. 63.- 13. Credo, istuc melius esse. “ I believe your way is
best.” Istuc here refers to de tuo jure concedere paululum. Some
refer it to what Sannio had said vs. 11 ; “ Ι never purchase hope with
ready money ;” and render it : “ My own way, 1 believe, is best.” —
14. Quin, &c. “ But I had rather, when it was in my power, receive
prompt payment.’' — 15. Age novi tuum animum, &c. “ Pshaw 1 Ι
know your spirit: as if twenty minae now were any thing to you, in com-
parison of obliging my master!'’ To animum supply liberalem. Comp.
Heaut. iii. 3. 9. Usquam here has the signification of ullius aestimationis,
“ of any value.” Ullo loco and nullo loco are used in the same manner.
For the latter the Greeks use οὐδαμοῦ. See Turneb. Advers. xx. 31.
-— 16. Praeterea autem. [Syrus adds this carelessly.] — Hem! [Sannio
alarmed.] —- 17. Multa. “A large stock of goods.” The neuter gender
is artfully used here. Syrus, to speak openly, should have said multas
puellas. —- Hoc scio, δῖε. “ On this account, I know, your mind is in
suspense.’' Hoc for ob hoc. -— 18. Hoc ages. “ You will attend‘to
this,” ἰ. e. apply for the money. Comp. Andr. i. 2. 15; ii. 5. 43 Eun.

19. Nusquam pedem. Supply moveo, or profero: “ Ι do not stir a

by heaven! Urged by these hopes, they have undertaken this.'’ --
Timet. [Syrus aside :] “ He fears! Ι hinted Cyprus ; there’s the rub.'’
