Adelph. v. 8. 7. — 17. Mea causa. Comp. Eun. v. 8. 40. — Nil pol
jam, &a “ Those things have no allurements for me now.'’ -—- 18.

0 Dum aetatis tempus tulit. “ Whilst my age permitted‚'’ i. e. while I
was young. AEtatis tempus for aetas. Comp. Andr. i. 2. 17. Or, aetatis
tempus may be rendered “ the season of youth.’' Comp. Cic. Off. ii.
13. —- Perfuncta satis sum. “ I have sufficiently done with them.’'
“ I had my share.’' Perfunctus sometimes has the signification of usus.
Comp. Cic. ad Div. iv. 5. — Satias jam tenet, &c. “ My love of such
pursuits is turned to loathing.'' Comp. Eun. v. 5. 3. The same ex-
pression occurs in AEschines, Dial. iii. 13. ”Αλις ἔσχον τοῦ βήματος.
-· 19. Studiorum. Comp. Andr. i. 1. 29; Plaut. Mero. Prol. 40.
-- Ut necui mea longinquitas oetatis. Comp. Phorm. ii. 1. 84 ; ii. 3. 68.
Ut ne. For ne, as is usual in Terence. “ That no one may regret my
lengthened life.” The idea of the long life of a step-mother being
odious to her family, is applied in a very beautiful and uncommon
manner by Shakespeare:

‘¹ Now, sair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
Another moon: but, oh, methjnks, how slow
This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,
Like to a step-dame, or a dowager‚
Long withering out a young man’s revenue.'’
M. N. Dream, Act 1. Scene 1.

Longinquitas, used here to denote the length and duration of life—as in
Livy, v. 15 ; vii. 29 ς’ Propert. i. 6. 27—is more usually applied to place.
-— 21. Hic video me esse invisam. Though Sostrata industriously en-
deavours to stifle her resentment, yet, in spite of herself, some little
indignation, arising from a sense of the ill-usage she has received,
will mix in what she says: which the poet has purposely thrown into
her discourse, in order to paint the manners and express character. —-
Invisum. Menander : Πικρόν ἐστι θρέμμα ’γέρων ἐν οἰκίᾳ μένων.

22. Omnes causas praecidam. “ I shall remove all causes.’' So spem
praecidere, Cic. Verr. i. 7 ; ii. 62. — 24. Volgus mulierum. Comp.
Andr. iii. 4. 4. - Quod male audit. ‘⁴ For which the generality of
women are calumniated.'' This alludes to what had been said by
Laches, ii. 1. 4. Quod for propter quod. For male audit, see Phorm.
Prol. 203 ii. 3. 12. —25. Absque una hac. ‘⁶ Except in this one
thing.” A comic expression, wherein absque⁸ stands for nisi, “ if not,'’
“ but for,’' “ exceptstff Comp. Pkorm. i. 4. 11. Pamphilus is affected
with the complaisance which his mother shows him, and, at the same
time, is warmly attached to Philumena. He therefore says, that with
so good a mother, and so amiable a wife, he must have been the
happiest man in the world, but for this unlucky accident. — 27. Non
tute, διο. “ Will you not make up your mind to submit to a single
inconvenience, considering the general character of young wives, if
every thing else be according to your wish ?” Pamphilus had just said
that he was happy, but for one thing. His mother, who is a stranger
to his real thoughts, imagines that he complains of his wife's temper,
because it could not agree with hers. She therefore tells hm, that he
ought not to suffer a thing of that nature to destroy his happiness in
other respects, as nothing is more common in a young wife, than to
eontract a dislike to her mother-in-law. -· In animum induces. Comp.
ii. 2. 223 Heaut. Prol. 49.
