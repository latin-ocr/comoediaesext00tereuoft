ACT III. ScsNss V.

Donatus observes, that in some copies, this whole scene is wanting;
and Guyetus thinks this a sufficient reason to reject it altogether. He
cannot see how Hegio comes to address Sostrata, who appears neither
in this scene, nor the preceding. But he seems not to have attended
to what Hegio says a little before to Geta: Duc me intro ad Sostratam.
While, therefore, Demea speaks the next four verses, and goes off the
stage, Hegio is with Sostrata, and here is seen coming out, and talking
to her within; just as Lesbia, in the third act of the Andria, calls from
without to Archylis, who was within with Glycerium: and Chremes, in
the beginning of the fifth act of the Heauton Timorumenos, speaks from
the scene to his wife, Sostrata. Besides, in this scene, Hegio says,
Ego Micionem, si apud sorum ’st, conveniam. Without this, the third
scene of the next act, where we see Hegio and Micio together, will
not come in so properly. Colman, remarking on this scene, observes :
Ι must confess, that it appears to me, if not supposititious‚ at least
cold and superfluous; and the substance of it had better have been
supposed to have passed between ,Hegio and Sostrata within·

The metre is Trimeter Iambic, as in the former scene.

2. Fac consolere. Pamphila had many causes of anxiety, and there-
fore stood greatly in need of consolation. Hegio's concern for her
manifests great good nature and humanity: this is perfectly agreeable
to the design of the poet, who means to represent him as an amiable‚
endearing character. —Micz‘onem conveniam. The same phrase occurs
i. 2. 74. Comp. Cic. ad Div. v. 11. -- 4. Si ita est, facturus ut sit, διο.
“ If it so be, that he will do justice ;'' or, more briefly, “if he will do us
justice.” Periphrasis for sifacturus est, or sifaoeret. Comp. Hec. iii.
5. 51 3 iv. 1. 43 ; see Perizon. on Sanct. Min. i. 13.-6. Ut, quid agam,
διο. “ That I may at once know how to act.'' Hegio expresses himself
with a becoming modesty and reserve. He is unwilling to say any thing
harsh, or threaten, because it looks disrespectful, where there are any
hopes of obtaining an honourable satisfaction. Moreover, he takes care
to make Sostrata sensible that he would not be remiss in her affairs,
if justice were denied her, but take what further measures might be
necessary to redress her wrongs. Such is evidently the import of this
verse.

 

ACT IV. ScENa I.

We have seen before that Syrus despatched Demea into the country,
making him believe that his son was gone before him. Ctesipho him-
self was afraid, that upon his father‘s missing him from home, he
would come immediately, and inquire after him in town. These fears
he discovers to Syrus, who, in return, assures him he has nothing
