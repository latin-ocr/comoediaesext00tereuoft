, you 2’· Comp. Andr. iii. 5. 12; Cic. Cat. i. 2. -4-. Ubi sit, nescit.

“ Comp. Eun. ii. 3. 143 Flor. ii. 10. It is an usual effect of terror and
consternation, to throw the mind into such disorder and confusion,
that it is rendered incapable of reflection. —-— Creduas. An archaism
for credas.·—- 5. Abi, tange, διο. “ Do but go and touch him: he’s in a
shivering fit, 1⁹11 lay my life.'’ Comp. Adesph. iv. 4. 3. ——9. Non pol
temere ἐι, &c. “ It is not for nothing that you are so much afraid.'’ —
10. Recte sane. “ Oh, certainly not !” [Ironically] Comp. v. 3. 15.—l
Quando nil times, διο. “And since you are not afraid, and what I say
means nothing, tell it yourself.” ——- 11. Scelus! tibi narret? “ Is he
to tell it to gratify you, villain 2⁵⁹ Comp. Andr. iii. 5. 1. — 12. Eho ,Ι
tu, sce. “ Oh! you are there, are you? You have done rarely for
your brother !'’ This, Colman observes, is commonly translated,
’ “ that is no wonder, that you defend your brother :’' but it is a more
insulting speech of Phormio, alluding to the miserable condition to
which Chremes was reduced by Demipho’s advice. Thus in the fore-
going scene, Phormio says, much in the same spirit:

‘⁶ But, Demipho,
You have but ill consulted for your brother,
Το urge me to extremities.”

13. Mi vir, ὅτε. [To Chremes] Comp. Eun. i. 2. 6.-14. Tibi quidem.
Supply non opus est dieto. - 15. In Lemno. Phormio's speech, without
interruption, runs thus: In Lemno clam te umorem duxit, et inde, διο. —
16. Mi homo. [To . Phormio.] “ Good sir.’' Some suppose these
words directed to her husband, not imagining that she would use an
expression so familiar as mi homo to Phormio. But this criticism is
trifling. Mi homo was a common form of address at that time, and
used indiscriminately, even to people of low rank. — 18. Suscepit jam “
unam. “ And has already had one daughter.’' This is an insinuation,
that there may yet be more children. — Dum tu dormis. ‘⁶ While you
thought yourself secure.'' Colman says: “While you were left to
sleep in ignoranee alone.” Comp. Heaut. ii. 3. 101. — 20. Hoc actum ’st.
[Demipho, in reply to Chremes :] “ All's over with you now !’' This
and the following verses stand thus in the editions prior to Bentley's :

Pn- Hoc actum Ἢ. ΝΑ. An quic-quam hodie estfactum indignius .⁷
Qui mihi, ubi ad uxores ventum ’st, tum fiunt senes.
Demipho, te appell0‚ &c.

Here Phormio is made to say: “Itis a fact, Ι assure you.'‘ Hodie
in this verse does not signiiy time, but is expressive of indignation, as
in Virg. AEn. ii. 670.—21. Qui mi. 'she pronoun mi is redundant.
Comp. Heant. ii. 1. 8. Before these words, supply 1ιὶ sunt : ‘⁶ These
are men, who, I warrant you,” &c. ——22. Te appello. Supply ut testem.
—Distaedet. For valde pudet.-—- 23. Haec illae erant, διο. “ And were
these his frequent journeys, and. long delays at Lemnos ?” Comp.
Andr. i. 1. 99. —25. Meritum. sc. Chremem. Comp. i. 4. 28; Hec. iv,
4. 9 ς Plaut. Aul. iv. 10. 8. — 26. Sed ea quin, διο. Supply negare nun
poteris, or nemo negaverit. -- Verba fiunt mortuo. So surdo narrat fabu-
lam, in the same sense, Heaut. ii. l. 10. Νεκρῷ μύθους εἷς οὖς λέγεις.
This proverb arose, according to Erasmus, from the ridiculous custom
of thrice calling on the dead after their spirit had departed: whence
they were said to be conclamati. By mortuo we are to under-
stand the inexorable spirit of Nausistrata. Donatus and others think
