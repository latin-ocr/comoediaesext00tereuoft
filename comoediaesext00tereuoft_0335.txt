Ac’r 1. scr-:NE 1. 297

hearing of her engagement with Phaedria, resolved to part with the
girl on no other terms than those of her renouncing all communication

, with that youth. Thais, who desired above all things to have Pamphila

in her possession, had the day before, to please the captain, denied
Phaedria admittance ; but fearing he might take it ill, sends for him
now, to explain her reasons, and be reconciled. Phaedria, who was
altogether a stranger to her motives, is introduced here as standing
before the door, and so flul] of resentment at her behaviour on the
former evening, that he resolves not to enter her house, though sent for.

The metre of this scene is the same as in the Prologue.

l. Quid igitur, &a [Enter Phaedria in deep thought ,· and Parmeno]
“ And what then shall I do? not go? not now?’' διο. The intro-k
duction of the word igitur intimates, that they had been deliberating
before their entrance. This beautiful passage has been copied by*
Horace, Sat. ii. 3. 260, and by Persius, v. 172. Comp. Cic. Nat. Deor.
iii. 29. Horace differs in nothing from Terence, but in an image he'
gives of a tempest‚ to explain more agreeably the word incerta of the·
original. - 2. An potius ita me comparem? ‘⁴ Or rather shall Ι so
resolve?” Comp. Phorm. i. 1. 7.—4. Non, si. For non, etiamsi.
Comp. Andr. iv. 2. 12; Livy, v. 51. — Si me obsecret. Comp. Ovid‚
Rem. Am. 519; Tibull. ii. 6. 13. —— 5. Possis. Supply hoc perficere. -—
Nil prius, neque fortius. “Nothing more excellent, nothing more
brave.'' Comp. iii. 5. 19. Fortius is well illustrated by Ovid‚ Trist.
vi. 6. Fortiorest‚ quise, quam qui fortissima vincit Moenia, Sco. Comp.
Prol. Andr. vs. 27. — 6. Pertendes. Pertendere signifies “to perse-
vere to the end.'’ Comp. Andr. iii. 4. 9; Heaut. v. 5. 9. —- 7. Ubi
pati non poteris. “When you cannot endure to live without her.'’
Comp. Hec. i. 2. 108 ; Heaut. iv. 5. 13. -—— Cum nemo expetet. “ Unin-
vited.”-—8. Infecta pace. “Your peace unmade.’' This refers to
exclusit, vs. 4. ·- 9. Actum 'st : ilicet .· peristi. “ All ’s over ! ruined
and undone! '' For the· formula actum est see note Andr. iii. 1. 7.
Ilicet. “ There* is an end ; ruined ! ” This, like actum est, is a formula
of despair; and is tranferred from funerals. When the remains of the
deceased were laid in the tomb, the persons present were sprinkled
with pure water from a branch of olive or laurel, to purify them ; then
they were dismissed by the Praefiea, on pronouncing the solemn word
ilicet, i. e. ire licet, whence some write it illicet. Charisius and Dacier
take ilicet here in the signification of sine dubio, “doubtless.” -10.>
Eludet. “She will laugh at you.’' Comp. Curt. viii. 1. — Ubi te
victum senserit. ‘⁶ When she shall see you in her power.'' He that
«cannot resist the influence of love, is said to be victus. Comp. i.. 2. 9821
See Burmann on Ovid‚ Amor. 2. 18. 11.

12. Quae neque consilium, neque modum. ‘⁶ That which· has neith‘er-
wisdom nor moderation in itself cannot be ruled .by wisdom.’' Quis
modus adsit amori? Virg. Ecl. 2. 68. Φύσει ’γάρ ἐστι ἔρως τοῦ νουθετυὺν-
τος κωφόν,Μθῐιαηᾱει·. —- 14. In amore, διο. This passage is quoted
by Cicero, Qu. Tusc. iv. 35.— 15. Suspiciones. Comp. Andr. iii. 2. 21.
-- 17. Certa. An accusative plural· opposed to incerta, VS. 16, as
appears from Hor. Sat. ii. 3. 268.

Hoec si quis tempestatis prope ritu
Mobilia, et σασα fluitantia sorte, laboret
Reddere certe sibi, nihilo plus explicetsae si·
Insanire paret certa ratione modoque.
