48. Alio pacto, ὅτε. [Phaedria aside:] “I know no other way to
come off handsomely.” Comp. Heaut. iv. 2. 53 Phorm. v. 8. 58.
Terence never fails in his regard to morals. Phaedria was sensible
that this piece of dissimulation was contrary to the rules of strict-
virtue, and therefore endeavours here to excuse it from the necessity
he was under. —49. Actum’st siquidem. [Aside] Supply hic vera
dixit .- “ We are undone, if what he says be true.'' — Tu me hic etiam,
διο. [Αἰοτιάι] “ Do you think to play your tricks on me, you
rascal? '’ [Exit after Dorus. Manent Pythias and Dorias]

50. Technam. Τέχνην, “ trick‚'' or “ artifice.” Comp. Heaut, iii.
1. 62. - 51. Inveniam, ubi, &c. “ Ι will devise some means to-day of
being even with him.” The revenge of Pythias on Parmeno is very
artfully made productive of the catastrophe. — Parem referam gratiam.
Comp. ii. 3. 94. - 52. Quid faciendum censes ? “ What, in your
opinion, should be done? '' This is a formula borrowed from the
Roman senate. See Livy, i. 32. — 53. Utrum taceamne, an praedicem Ρ
“Shall I keep the matter secret, or declare the whole to Thais?”
Either of the particleS‚ utrum, ne, is redundant. When both are used,
they are generally separated by tmesis, as here. Comp. Adelph. iii.
3. 28; Plaut. Most. iii. 1. 151; Cic. Nat. Deor. ii. 34; Acad. ii. 22;
Inv. ii. 34.—54. Quod scis, nescis. Nescis here for the imperative.
“ If you are wise, be ignorant of all.” Oxymoron. Comp. Heaut.
iv. 4. 26; Plaut. Mil. ii. 6. 88. —- 55. Hac re et te, διο. “ So shall
you rid yourself of all this trouble, and do a kindness to our mistress
too.'' Evolves for expedies, “ you will deliver yourself from all blame
on this account.” Comp. Phorm. v. 4. 5. By illi is meant ΤῙιαὶε.
Donatus refers illi to Pamphila, and Westerhovius to Phaedria.
Pamphila, says Madame Dacier, was too well born to conceal what
had happened to her. Such a silence would have, in some measure,
implied a consent. Virtue knows none of these disguises 3 it may be
unfortunate, but can never be blamable. It can therefore be Thais
only that Pythias would do a grateful office to in concealing Pamphila's ’
misfortune; for she would without doubt be anxious to have this kept
secret till she brought Chremes to acknowledge her for his sister; lest,
if it should be known before, the dishonour it was like to bring upon
him, might make him averse to the discovery. - Feceris. For facies.
Comp. Heaut. i. 1. 122; Plzorm. v. 6. 42.

56. Id modo dic. “ Say nothing, but that Dorus is gone off.” Id
for hoc. —- Sed videon’ Chremen ? “ But do I not see Chremes? ” By
this she knew that Thais would presently return, and because a quar-rel
had arisen between her mistress and the captain. -— 57. Inde. From
the captain‘s house. - Jam tum. At the very time of Dorias's -
departure. — Inceperat turba. ‘⁴ A quarrel had commenced.” Comp.
Andr. i. 4. 8. —58. Aufer aurum hoe. “Carry in that casket of
jewels.’' — Scibo. Archaically for sciam. [Exit Dorias]

 

ACT IV. Semi: V.

Chremes is introduced here half tipsy‚ and wondering at the strange
effect which wine had upon him. The* change in his behaviour is very
natural, and gives us the true picture of one, who having been all
his lifetime accustomed to sobriety‚ is unwarily drawn into excess.
