117. Me miseram! We ought here to observe the great address and,v
judgment of the poet, in not making Thais speak of the girl’ s bro—
ther till after Phaedria and Parmeno are gone. By this he is lest at
liberty to conduct the plot according to his first intention3 and Par-
meno hears nothing that might hinder him from giving Chaerea the
advice we meet with in the sequel. For it is not likely he would have
dared to act in that manner, had he known sor certain that the girl was-
a citizen of Athens, and that Thais had come to the knowledge of her>

relations. — Parvum hic habeat mihi fidem. ‘⁴ He little credits me.'’ Forv

ACT II. Seme Ι.

In this scene we have Phaedria giving orders to his servant Par-'-
meno about the Eunuch and Ethiopian girl, which he intended to senff
as a present to Thais. After recommending this to himin the warmest
manner, he proposes to go into the country, where he would remain
till the two days, agreed upon between him and Thais, were expired.
Parmeno, who was no stranger to his weakness in this respect, and
knew how little he was able to keep such a resolution, freely tells him
his mind. Phaedria, conscious that there was good reason to suspect
his steadiness, confirms himself‘ in his first resolution, and to shew
Parmeno that he was still able to exert the man when he pleased..
departs, firmly purposing to remain in the country for three whole days.

The metre of this scene is various: verses 1, 10, 11, are Tetrameter·
