towards his son and Crito, and consents so readily to the marriage
between Pamphilus and Glycerium, as soon as he understands that she
is his own daughter.

13. Alium . . . atque. “Other than Ι was.” Writers of pure Latinity
always after aliud put ac, oratque, in the signification of “than ;’' never
quam, except when non, nihil, or the like preceded. See Burm. on
Petron. c. 86. — 14. Si in rem 'st utrique. “If it be for their mutual
advantage.’' Comp. Hec. ii. 2. 7; Sall. Cat. c. 10. Ex re is used in
the same sense, Plcorm. v. 7. 76. Contra nem means the reverse. See
Cic. Div. v. 20. — Ut fiant, arcessi jube. “Let her be sent for, to be
wed sorthwith.'’ — 16. In commune. “Equally for the advantage of
both.’' In the next verse Bentley reads Pamphiloque, which Ruhnken
approves, for the dative is often put for the genitive. So Heaut. ii.

18. Itaque. Foret ita. Comp. Livy, i. 4; iii. 30. So neque is some· ι
times put for et ne. — 20. Audio. [Chremes ironieally,] ‘⁴ Ι hear you.'' s
'Audio here denotes that Chremes gave but little credit to what Simo
said with respect to his son and Glycerium. Comp. Phorm. v. 7. 54. ’ᾗ
Audio, says Bentley, sometimes denotes a concession made to an adver· f
sary, and is equivalent to esto, sit ita. Comp. Eun. ii. 3. 80. Cic.
pro Rosc. Amer. c. 18.—21. Fabula. “Idle tales!'’ in the same
sense as audio, vs, 20. —23. Integratio. “Is the renewal.’' Some
editions have redintegratio. The sentiment contained in this line seems
to have been borrowed from Plaut. Amph. iii. 2. 60, though the follow-
ing is said to be from Menander: Ὀργὴ φιλούντων ὀλίγον ἰσχύει χρόνον.
— 24. Ut ante'eamus. ‘⁴ That we prevent it‚” i. e. the renewal of their
affections: ‘⁴ that we anticipate the evil.'’-—26. Prius, quam, &c. “Ere
these women’s wiles, their wicked arts, and tears made up of fraud,
shake his weak mind, and melt it to compassion.''——29. Conjugio libe--
rali devinctum. “United to a well-bred spouse.’‘ This is said in oppo—
sitien to what Glycerium then appeared to be, who, as her parents were
yet unknown, passed at Athens for a stranger. AEterno devinctus
amore, Virg. AEn. viii. 394. — 30. Eae illis sese emersurum malis. .
“ That he will rise above the guilt that sinks him novV.” Emergere is ⁴
properly applied to those who, sunk under water, by great exertion ἓ
extricate themselves. Hence it is transferred to those who are freed ’-
·from any difficulty. Comp. Cic. pro Coel. c. 31; Nep. Att. c. 11.

31. At ego non posse arbitror, &e. “ For me, Ι cannot think that
he ’ll be constant, or that I can bear it.” Here we have neque. . meque
after a negative, in place of aut...aut. This is in imitation of the
Greek. Me perpeti, “ that I can endure his inconstancy.’' Fathers ¹
had such power over their children, that when a husband behaved ill, ἰ
they might take away their daughter from him. Chremes, therefore, ’κ
means that he could not think of marrying his daughter to a man who '1
would probably slight her ς t-he consequence of which would be, that he ³
should take her home again. — 33. Nisi periclum seceris. ‘⁴ Unless
you make the trial.'’ -35. Nempe incommoditas, &c. “ Why, to be
sure, all the inconvenience comes ultimately to this, a separation, if it
should happem which heaven avert !” Here Simo artfully uses the
word incommoditas, when he should have used a stronger term, cala-
mitas—38. Amico filium restitueris. “ You will restore a son to
your friend, who can hardly acknowledge him now on account of his
vices-'⁹ Restitueris for the future indicative restitues. Comp. Adelph.
