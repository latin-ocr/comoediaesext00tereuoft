318 EUNUCHUS.

Comp. ii. 3. 56; Adesph. iii. 4. 23. -- Credere omnem exereitum.
“ Entrusted me with the whole management of the war.” —- 13. Tum
sicubi, &c. ‘⁴ And then, whenever satiety of company or hate of
business seized him—when he would repose—as if —you understand
me 2 '' Odium for taedium. Comp. v. 5. 2; Hec. ii. l. 22.— 18.
Regem. See note on i. 2. 88.— Elegantem. Ruhnken considers this as
put for eligere scientem, “ of exquisite discrimination.’' Comp. iii. 5. 18.

19. Perpaucorum hominum. ‘⁴ A man nice in the choice of his friends.”
“ No general man, I warrant you.” That is, one who admits but few
into familiarity with him. Horace uses the same phrase, in the same
sense, speaking of Maecenas, Sat. i. 9. 44 : Paucorum hominum ut mentis
bene sauoe. In like manner Cicero tells us, in the book de Fato,
that Scipio having engaged two or three friends to sup with him upon
sturgeon, and seeming inclined to detain some others who dropped in
upon him, Pontius whispered to him, “ Take care, Scipio,” Accipemr
iste paucorum hominum est, “ the sturgeon does not love much com-
pany.'' This passage of Cicero, quoted by the commentators both on
Horace and Terence, puts the meaning of the phrase out of all doubt3
and indeed in this sense the speech of Thraso more properly follows
up the speech immediately preceding, and, without the least violence
to the natural flow of the dialogue, takes off the awkwardness os an
aside from the reply of Gnatho, and leaves him that easy raillery
which distinguishes him in most parts of the play. —Immo nul-
lorum, &c. ‘⁴ Nay, he must have kept no other company, if he was
intimate with you.'' The captain says perpaucorum, and the parasite,
improving upon it, says nullorum.

20. Invidere. For invidebant. So mordere, pendere, &c. afterwards.
-- 21. Mordere. “ Railed at me in secret.” Comp. Cic. Att. xiii. 12.
Hence morsus famae, Sil. Ital. vii. 271. -— Floeci pendere. The same as
flocci facere, ii. 3. 12.—22. Misere. For valde. “ They envied me
exceedingly.’' Donatus thinks misere alludes to the wretched feelings
of the envious, “They wretchedly envied me;” because misere and
impense are generally synonymous. But then we must recollect the
character of the speaker, which will also account for the tautology in
illi invidere. — 23. Impense. “ In particular.” Ruhnken explains this
by valde, vehementer, agreeing, no doubt, with Donatus as to the meaning
of misere in vs. 22. Comp. iii.. 5. 39.-—25. Belluas. All animals
of the larger sort were called belluae. Elephants in particular were so
called, κατ’ ἑξοχήν. Comp. Juvenal, x. 1583 Flor. ii. 6. We must
here observe, with Madame Dacier, that he who had the charge of the
elephants was a very considerable officer, and had a great number of
servants under him. It was not, therefore, a small matter in Thraso, to
have had a dispute with a man of that importance. It is not, moreover,
a light boast which he makes here. The word Indicis ought not to be
forgotten. This vain fool imagined that it gave a higher idea of his
boldness and courage, and that the man who commanded the Indian
elephants must be much more sormidable than he who commanded
other elephants, because they were of a larger size, and commonly
reckoned more fierce. - 27. Jugularas hominem. “ You silenced the
man.'' This word is chosen in preference to occideras, as being less
equivocal; as if he had silenced him with the swerd, and not with
words. —— Quid ille ? “ What did he say to it ?'’

28. Di vostram fidem! [Parmeno aside:] “Good heavens! the
