“From his school.” Palaestra was properly the school of gymnastic
exercises for the-Grecian youth. Geta, therefore, in allusion to that,
pleasantly calls Dorio’s house the palaestra of Phaedria, much ‘in the

ACT ΙΙΙ. ΞσΕΝΕ II.

This scene furnishes a proof, how justly Geta had called Dorio¹s
house Phaedria’s school of exercise ; for here we have a lively example
of it. The youth accosts him with the most earnest importunities: the
time he demands, too, is but short—three days—but nothing avails.
Antipho and Geta also join in the request, with no better success. He
is inexorable to every thing they say ς and lets them know that interest
alone governs him. He had an offer of ready money for his slave3 and
would not, by all the whining and whimpering they could use, be brouff-Jht
to relinquish present certainty for distant and future prospect. e
therefore tells them, that as the money was to be paid the next morn-

Metuo lenonem is similar in constructIOn to Eun. iii. 5. 62.· To quid
supply mali. Fuat forfuerit or sit. The common reading is,

An. Hei l metuo lenonem, ne quid suo suat capiti. Gn. Idem eya metuo.

On this Patrick has the following note : It were endless to repeat the
several conjectures of commentatore. upon this passage. One of the
most specious is that of Muretus, who tells ηε, that in a manuscri t of '
his the text runs thus, Metuo lenonem, ne quid suat suo capiti. 'oh
he thus explains: After Antipho had said, metuo lenonem, ne quid suat,
i. e. ne quid mali struat, and the spectators naturally suppose he is to
add Phaedrz'ae capiti, he suddenly changes the form of the expression, and
turns it into an imprecation against Dorio himself ; by saying Μ
capiti, q. d. quae res ipsi lenoni male vertat. But in my opinion, amuel!
easier and more simple explanation may be given of these words-jvdssell
