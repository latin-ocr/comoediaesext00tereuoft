HEAUTON TIMORUMENOS‚ iii. 1. 1.——Lucz·scz·t hoc jam, &m

‘⁴ It is beyond all doubt that this play was acted at two different and
distinct times; the first two acts at night, after sunset3 and the three
remaining acts, the next morning, at break of day: the time between
the second and third act was taken up with the carousal and supper,
given by Chremes. Menander, upon account of the feasts then cele-
brating, had a right to divide this comedy in this manner: Terence
took the same liberty, and with the same justice, since his plays were
represented at Rome upon the like solemn occasions. Eugraphius,
who wrote notes upon this comedy‚ was of opinion that this methodwas
without precedent3 but he is mistaken. Aristophanes did the very
same thing: the first two acts of his Plutus were performed in the even-
ing, the remaining three early the next morning3 and the time between
the second and third actis employed by Plutus in paying a visit to the
temple of AEsculapius, where he passes the whole night. If we could
precisely tell the hour at which Aristophanes opens his play, we should
undoubtedly find he had not transgressed the unity of the time (twelve
ho'urs) which is requisite in dramatic pieces. It is at least certain,
that Terence has not exceeded it here; and that he is as exact in this
particular as in every other. The play begins a little aster eight at
night. The two first acts do not last above two hours; they then go to
supper: this makes an interval of six or seven hours. The· third act
begins at break of day, as Terence has taken care to point out, luciscit
hoc jam. So that the three acts, which could not last three hours, must
have ended about seven in the morning. But what is chiefly remarkable
is, that this interval is interwoven with the subject matter of the play, as
well as it is in Aristophanes. Chremes, during that time, observes the
freedoms which pass between Clitipho and Bacchis3 and this creates
great part of the business of the third act. The critics were little atten-
tive to this, when they cried out vasta et hians et inanis comoedia est, ‘ there
is a void, a gap, an emptiness in this comedy ε’ which is far, very far,
from being true; for what they call so, has a very material connexion
with the play, and may be said to be almost the very ground-work of it.
Had Terence divided it so that this interval had not entered into the
subject, it would, indeed, have been ridiculous and insupportable. Were
we to act one of Moliere’s plays thus by piece-meal, the beginning to-
night‚ and the end to-morrow morning, every body would laugh at the
partition 3 but Terence and Menander, who were perfect masters nithe
drama, attempted it with success And indeed it might even now-a-days
be done with propriety, nay, would become necessary, provided it could
be executed with equal judgment and address.”—DAcmn.

“The idea of the above note, as well as of several others of Madame
Dacier, was first suggested by Scaliger, who, in the sixth book of his
Poeta-s, first broached the notion of this division os the comedy in repre-
sentation, in order to vindicate our author from the imputation ofhaving
left an unwarrantable chasm between the second and third acts. And
it is something whimsicaL that this great critic, aster having depreciated
our author's merit in the grOSS, more than any of his predecessore,
should take it into his head to justify him against every objection that
