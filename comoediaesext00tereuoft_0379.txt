ACT V. Scmm II.

Chaerea had gone with Antipho, that he might put off the Eunuch's
dress at his house, as being the nearest place of any convenience 3 but
as both the old people happened to be at home, he could not enter
without being seen by them. As he stands deliberating before the door,
he sees an acquaintance at some distance, and, wishing to avoid him,
runs through several unfrequented lanes, until he unwarily stumbles
upon Thais. At first he is a little embarrassed, but recollecting him-
self, boldly goes up to her. She addresses him in a jesting way3 but
soon comes to expostulate with him seriously, upon the affront he had
offered her. Chaerea endeavours to excuse himself, and on his pro-
mising to marry Pamphila, they are reconciled.

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.

1. Apud Antiphonem. [Enter Chaerea, at a distance] Chaerea assigns

very natural reasons for not having changed his dress: in which it is
worth while to observe the art of Terence, since the sequel of the fable
made it absolutely necessary that Chaerea should appear again before
Thais, in the habit which he wore while in her house. —— 2. Quasi dedita

11. Bone vir, Dore. Thais is not ignorant that Chaerea is the
person to whom she is now speaking3 but she artfully dissembles,
that she may use him with the more freedom, as supposing him her
servant— 12. Aufugistz'n’ ? “ So, sir, you have run away, have
you?'’ Comp. iv. 4. 2 3 Cic. ad Div. v. 9. —Hera‚ factum. “ I admit

“And are you sufficiently pleased with the trick? ” A formula of
expostulating with a person who has been detected in something for

manuscripts and printed copies have te impune abiturum,· but the
former reading is correct. Comp. v. 6. 18. The phrase impune abire,
