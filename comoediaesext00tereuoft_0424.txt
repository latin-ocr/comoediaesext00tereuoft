18.p Quid istic narrat? What Syrus says here, breaking in upon
the discourse of the father and son, requires a little explanation. He had
before said, (vs. 3.) aeta haee res est.- perii! being in fear for himself,
and the project he had concerted. Now, quid istic nar-rat? whic .
must be taken as if Syrus approved of what the old man had said,
joined in the reproof. “What can Clitipho say for himself now?
what has he to answer ? ’¹ Whenoe Clitipho, perii! ⁴⁴ I am undone1’'
What, is he my enemy too? does he help to spirit up my father against
me? And when Syrus still persists, he begs him to be silent: Tace,
sodes. Others think these words addressed to Clitipho: (Audis) quid
istie (pater tuus) narrat? “Do you hear what your father says?
Did I not tell you it would be so?”-—-20. Recte sane. ⁴⁴’Tis very

39. Fuit quaedam anus. Syrus pretends that he had concerted this
against Menedemus, to obtain some money of him for this courtezan.
This was specious enough, yet Chremes is dissatisfied with it.
However, it is of service in the end; for when Antiphila was dis-
covered to be Chremes' daughter, he could not avoid paying the price
of her ransom, and thus out of his own pocket furnish the money
wanting for Bacchis—40. Hic. At Athens—Huic drachumam,
“To this old woman Bacchis lent a thousand drachmae.” A thousand
drachmae are equal to ten minae, ²4332. 5s. lod. of our money. See
