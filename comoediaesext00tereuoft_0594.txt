'ACT IV. ScENE IV.

We have seen that Antipho overheard all that was said in the last
, scene, and what perplexity he was thrown into by Geta’s ambiguous
behaviour. Now, therefore, that both the old men have retired, he
comes forward and interrogates the slave respecting his conduct, with
great heat and impatience. Geta endeavours to satisfy him that there
is no danger, and at last, with some difficulty, brings him to temper.

This scene consists of T rimeter Iambics.

you no other concern but getting the money for Phaedria? have you
not neglected my affairs, and even treacherously ruined me '2⁹' Geta
understood Antipho’s question as if he had said : Satin’ id est pecuniae ?
and accordingly answers: “Whether it be, or be not, sufficient, 1
know not3 but this I do know, it is all you ordered me to obtain.”
Satin’ est id is a usual form of chidjng. Comp. Eun. v. 2. 12.--3.
