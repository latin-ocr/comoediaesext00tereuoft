gentium. The word gentium is redundant here, as in the phrase nusquam
gentium, Adebph. iv. 2. 1. — 12. In convivium illam ? Supply arcessas,
or adducas. ‘⁴ What! bring her to a banquet ἱ ” It was contrary to
the manners of the Greeks, for women to appear at table with strangers.
Thais would not admit Pamphila to the entertainment, lest she might
hear things offensive to chastity, in such free conversation as was usual
on those occasions. For as she suspected her to be a citizen, and
designed to restore her to her relations, she was unwilling that any-
thing should happen which might injure her reputation. —- Miles ten-
dere inde ad jurgium. “ The captain then persisted till it came to a
quarrel.''

13. Aurum sibi clam mulier demit. “Thais secretly took off her
golden ornaments.'' At Athens, courtezans were forbidden by law to
wear gold or jewels3 but these laws were not very strictly kept. They
were also forbidden to have servants ; and yet nothing was more com-
mon than for the more noted to have whole troops attending them.
Some tell us, that it was usual for them to have their jewels carried
to the place where they intended to appear dressed, and there put
them on; and when about to return, send them away again before
them. If this be true, it explains the reason of Thais’s behaviour
here. Some would rather attribute it to her fear, lest the captain
should use her rudely. —— 14. Se illiue subducet. Supply ut. “ That
she will secretly withdraw herself.” Comp. iv. 7. 25, where clam is
added, as in Nepos. Alcib. c. 4. [Exit Dorias] ’

 

ACT IV. Semi: ΙΙ.

Phaedria, according to his resolution, went into the country with a
design of remaining there three whole days. But, as lovers are very
apt to change, in going along, revolving one thing aster another, and
finding himself very uneasy at the thought of being absent from Thais
for so long a time, he wisely concludes, since he cannot have her
company, at least to have the satisfaction of seeing her. He is there-
fore introduced here as come back, and talking over with himself the
reason of a behaviour so full of weakness and irresolution.

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.

1. Dum rus eo. [Enter Phaedria] Here the poet artfully finds a
reason to bring Phaedria back again ; as he at first with equal art sent
him out of ⁴the way, to give probability to those incidents necessary to
happen in his absence. — Inter vias. For iuter eundum. Comp. Cic.
