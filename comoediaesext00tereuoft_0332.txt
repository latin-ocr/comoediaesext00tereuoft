PRoLoGtm.

In this Prologueffhe author inveighs, according to his usual manner, ,
against his adversary, whom, by enumerating some of his errors, he ,
exposes to the greatest ridicule and contempt. He afterwards defends ’“
himself against the charge of having stolen the greater part of hin Ϊ
fable from Naevius and Plautus. Finally, he begs the attention of the ²
spectators during the representation.

This Prologue consists of Trimeter Iambics. η

1. Sa· quisquam est, qui studeat. For si qui sunt, qai studeant.
Bentley and Ruhnken read in the text qui studeant, the latter citing. ¹
Livy, ix. 36 ; xxxviii. 26. But Hermann has shown that the singular, v
and not the plural, must be used here. Placere se, as in Sall. Cat. c. 1·- Γ
qui sese student praestare. Comp. Andr. iv. 5. 23 Cic. Offi ii. 20. -Pla- , ³
cere bonis quam plurimis, et minime multos laedere. ‘⁴ To plesse as many
worthy men as possible, and give offence to few.” Minime multos is ’
put for paucissimos, and is opposed to quam plurimis. Eugraphius ’
interprets it: ‘⁶ To please the worthy rather than the many,” i. e. ‘⁶ the ¹
bad.” —3. In his, sce. Among such Terence enrolls his name. His ”
refers to the plural implied in vs. 1. Nomen profitetur is a metaphor .
from the enrolling of recruits‚ who, when they gave in their names. ζ
were said profiteri. Comp. Caes. B. G. vi. 23; Livy, ii. 19. — 4. ,ἢ .
quis. Lucius Lavinius is meant. See Prol. to Andr. vs. 7. Tum is ÷
put here for praeterea, as in Virg. Ecl. vi. 6-1. -- Inclementius. “ Τοσι-
severely.” Thus Plaut. Amph. ii. 2. 110. Hac in me inclementer dicit. Ἰ
Comp. Livy, ix. 34. —6. Responsum, non dictum esse, δὶα. “ Τὶιειῒ it' it j
an answer, and not an attack‚ because he was the aggressor.'’ —Diotunu a
here for maledictum. —7. Qui bene vertendo. “Who· by a faithful· ἶ
translation.” He means a servile, verbum verbo translation, which is α '.
breach of the precept given by Horace, Epist. ad Pis. vs. 133. J
Seribendo male is the effect of bene vertendo, as Ruhnken properly .’
explains it. Bene vertendo, et easdem scribendo male is therefore put
for bene vertendo easdem scripsit male, et ex Graecis, διο. Some by >
scribendo male understand the arrangement of the scenos, and the 5
manner of treating the subject. , ’·

9. Menandri Phasma. Φάσμα, “ the Phantom,” was the title of κ Τ
comedy of Menander. In this play a young man looking through a. ’
hole in the wall, which divided his father’s house from a· neighbour’ “
beholds a virgin of extraordinary beauty, and is affected with an anfi}
reverence, as at the sight of a deity3 from which the play is calleci»¹
“ the Phantom.'’ The young man's step-mother, who had the child hx
a secret amour previously to her marriage with'his father, and educatu&
her privately in the house of her next-door neighbour, is representa& ,
to have made the hole in the wall, and to have deeked the passage with ’ ⁷
garlands and green branches, that it might look like a consecra& J
place, whitherj she daily went to her devotione, and used to call het ⁵

daughter to conversewith her there. ΤῘιθ youth, coming by degree, ς
