ACT II. Scmm IV.

AEschinus again appears, and with the same haughty air towards.
Sannio, as knowing that was the most likely way to humblc him, and
bring him to terms. In this scene the several characters are preserved
with wonderful exactness : the discourse runs upon different subj ects, but
each is mindful of that which it was natural should most employ his
thoughts. Sannio is attentive only to the recovery of his money.
Every thing he does or says tends to this. AEschinus still speaks
with his usual haughtiness, and a threatening tone3 but whispers
Syrus, to know how Sannio stood inclined; and, when told that he
has come to terms, resolves to go immediately and pay him off.
Ctesipho's first concern is, to express his gratitude to his brother:
which when done, lie thinks how to provide against his father's
hearing any thing of what has happened ; and for this purpose begs of
Syrus that Sannio may be paid as soon as possible.

The metre is Tetrameter Iambic Acatalectic.

sign of the money, he changes his note: Occidi, nil video. He is not

real affliction.—2. Te ipsum quaero. “You are the very person I
