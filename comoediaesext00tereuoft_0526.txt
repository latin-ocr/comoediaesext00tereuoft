jam scibo. Comp. Eun. iv. 4. 58. —— 5. Phidippe. [Laches goes apto
ltim.]—Etsi ego, &c. “ Although Ι own myself indulgent to my
family, yet my complacency and easiness runs not to that extreme,
that my good nature corrupts their morals.” This expostulation of
Laches with Phidippus is a most faithful and elegant copy of nature.
His peace of mind being disturbed by the disorder he finds in his
family, his ill-humour, like that of most married men, breaks out first
upon his wife3 but as family soenes, whether sweet or bitter, are
seldom agreeable to a third person, the presence of Phidippus imme-
diately puts an end to their dialogue. But the circumstance which
seems most to be admired is, that although Laches had Just before-
thrown the whole blame on Sostrata, he 'no sooner sees Phidippus,
than he endeavours to exculpate his own family, and to insinuate that.
the whole fault lies on that of his neighbour.—6. Sed non adeo.
There is something particular here in the use of the partiales, where
secl comes in after etsi, and is of the same import with tamen. We find
an instance of it in Cic. ad Div. ix. 16, and in Hor. Sat. i. 10. 67. —-
Ut mea facilitas, διο. Comp. Adelph. iii. 3. 37.—7. Si idem faceres.
Comp. Eun. ii. 3. 98. —— In rem vostram, δίο. Comp. Andr. iii. 3. 14.
The editions before Bentley's have nostram et vostram. On this
Ruhnken observes, that the ancients never had any idea of the polite·
ness of the present day, which teaches us to place our own name last.
See Burmann on Lucan, ix. 985. —— 8. Nunc video, διο. “ But now, Ι
see you are wholly in their power.” Comp. Cic. Epist. ad Att. iii. 223
ad Div. v. 4. 1
Heia vero l “ See there! ” These words, seemingly so easy, have
yet puzzled the commentators. Donatus makes them an adverb
of interruption. Madame Dacier interprets them as addressed by
Phidippus to his daughter, in reference to their conversation within,
signifying: “Did Ι not tell you they would be offended at your*
absence 2 ’' For my part, says Patrick, I take it to be an emotion of¹⁴
surprise mixed with discontent. Phidippus, while he is yet discoursing
with his daughter, is suddenly accosted by Laches, and in language, too,
that he did not much like. Upon which he exclaims, Heia vero Ι
which words seem to answer pretty nearly to our phrase, “Look ye
there now! ’⁷ which is osten used on the like occasions—9. Adii te
heri. Comp. i. 2. 115, 116. ——Amisti. By syncope for amisisti. This
is common in Terence.— 10. Perpetem. The same as perpetuam.
This word is used by Plautus, Amph. ii. 2. 100, and is found also iu
a fragment of Pacuvius, ap. F est. — 11. Celare te iras. Comp. Adelph.
i. 1. 29. Iras here signifies the “ cause for anger.'' -Proferz ‘⁸ De-
clare it.'' Comp. Heaut. v. 2. 41- 13. Te judice ipso. So in Virg.
Ecl. iv. 59. — Sin ea 'st‚ &c. ‘⁶ But if her sickness only is the cause of
her remaining in yourfamily.”—- 15. Si metuis, ut. Ut for ne non. Comp.
Andr. v. 4. 11. Construe satis with diligenter. Curetur is a medical
term. Comp. Curt. v. 6. 3.-—— 16. Concedo nt. A similar construction
occurs in Cic. ad Div. x. 29. Elsewhere (x. 3,) this verb is consmed
with qai : thus, Nemini concedentem, qni tibi vetustate necessitudinis
potior possit esse.—-- 17. Id adeo gnati causa. “ And that exceedingl
on my son's account,” i. e. Ι love her exceedingly, διο. Comp. fid. 36.
It was necessary to add this circumstance, to gain credit, and to
prevent unjust suspicions—18. Magni facere. The same as -magni
aestimare. The common editions have magnificare. >-19. *Neque adeo,
