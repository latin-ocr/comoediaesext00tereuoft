A similar expression occurs Eun. i. 2. 84. But this great critic reads
intercludier in both places, omitting in me here, and in te in the other
passage. According to this, tibi depends on intercludier: ‘⁴ 1 would
not that any advantage should be withheld from you.’'

ACT III. SCENE IV.

Simo orders Davus to be called, to satisfy Chremes that Pamphilus
and Glycerium were at varianoe, and that the former was now willing
to take a wife. Davus having no suspicion of what had happened, but
secure that no marriage was intended, is of himself coming out to
have the pleasure of bantering Simo a little, when, to his great
mortification, he learns the ill success of his project, and is thrown
into the greatest perplexity. He dissembles, however, his concern as
much as possible before the old man ; and Chremes, imagining that all
is well, returns home to give the proper orders.

The metre of this scene is various. Line 1 is scanned with the
last of the foregoing scene. Vs. 2 is Tetrameter Iambic Hypermeter;
but the last syllable may be scanned with the following verse. Vss.
3—25 and 27 are Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic; 26, Dimeter
Iambic Acatalectic. '

1. Ad te ibam. [Enter Davus, to urge the conclusion qs the marriage]

Donatus, always promises something important. —— 4. Quod volgus
