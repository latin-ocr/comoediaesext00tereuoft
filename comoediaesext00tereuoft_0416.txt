her virtue; nor is she infiuenced by any consideration of tlre miseries
likely to attend vice, but purely by a natural bias to virtue. —·17.
Ah ,Ι [Clinia, overhearing.]

18. Ergo. “On account of thy virtuous innocence.''—Redueem
me facis. “ You restore me.” Comp. Hec. v. 4. 12. These words are
spoken by Clinia to himself, looking earnestly at his mistress, and
highly pleased with the kind declaration he had just overheard het
make in his favour. If the beauty of a play consists in representing
the passions well, and making the spectators themselves feel in some
Ι measure what passes before them, never did a poet succeed better than
’ Terence in this place. —20. Tui carendum. This is a Grecism': σοῦ
στερητέον, The same words are found in a fragment of Naevius, cited
by Gellius, xix. 7, carendum tui est. — Syre, vix suffero. Madame
Dacier, contrary to the authority of all MSS. and editions, adopts a
conceit of her father's in this place, and gives the speech to Clitipho,
whom she supposes to have retired to a hiding-place, where he might
overhear the conversation, and from whence he peeps out and addresses
this to Syrus. This she calls an agreeable jeu de theam-e, and doubts not3
but all lovers of Terence will be obliged to her father for so ingenious
a remark. On this, Colman observes: To me, instead of an agreeable
jeu de thetim-e, it appears a most absurd and ridiculous device3 parti·-
cularly vicious in this place, as it most injudiciously tends to interrupt
the course of Clinia’s more interesting passion, so admirably delineated
in this little scene. — 21. Haecine ingenium. “ This temper,” so sweet,
so chaste, so amiable; meaning Antiphila. Comp. Andr. i. 1. 26, 1252
i. 5. 40. -— Meo modo. “ As Ι please.” Comp. Phorm. v. 7. 69. Fmor
is found with an accusative also in Lucr. iii. 954 ; Plaut. Asin. v. 2. 68 ;
and in Cato, R. R. c. 149. — 22. Ut patrem tuum vidi esse, διο. “ If I
may judge your father's disposition, he has more troubles yet in store
for you.” Thus also Reinhardt ε Quem ego novi patris tui animum,-
ille multa tibi etiam in posterum negotia facesset. Ruhnken calls this,
versus conclamatas, nec sine meliorum manuscriptorum ope restituendus.
Schmieder thinks habitum here to signify “strength of body,’' (comp.-
Eun. ii. 2. 11,) and thus interprets it: “ Your father, as far as I can see,
is likely to live long‚'' Sco. The Bipont editors render it parce ac
duriter se habentem, eoque et te darius habiturum. Bentley conjectures„
Immo, ut patrem tuum vidi, partes diu etiam duras dabit. But this, as
Reinhardt observes, is interpreting, not emending, the passage. Bothe·
proposes what seems more probable: Immo ut patrem tuum vidi ex abitu
ίαο, etiam se durum dabit. —Duras dabit. Supply vices, or partes, from
Eun. ii. 3. 63. >

23. Quisnam hic adulescens. [Bacchis seeing Clima] —— Intuitur.-
An ancient form for intuetur. —- Ah l [Antiphila seeing him].—— Recine
me. — [To Bacchis .·] “ Support me 1 '' Comp. Plaut. Curc- ii. 3. 31.

anime mi. [Clinia running up to Antiphila.]—-27. Salvum advenisse
gaudeo. Supply te. Comp. Ean. v. 5. 6; Cic. Att. v. 21. -—- Teneone
te. “And do I hold thee, my Antiphila? '² An usual form among
friends returning from abroad‚ and embracing each other, aster a long
absence. Comp. Senec. Herc. Fur. 623 ; Petron. c. 139 3 Sueton.
