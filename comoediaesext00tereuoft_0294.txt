Comp. i. 1. 142. Bentley reads, Hodie observarem quid, and expungens ξ
the next verse as spurious, though contained in all MSS. and printed
copies 3 because, as Pamphilus has not disappeared since Byrrhia left the
stage, the latter could not say nunc hunc venientem sequor. On this g
Colman observes: If we suppose hunc to refer to Simo, the difficulty is Ῑ
removed: and that the pronoun does really signify Simo, is evident
from the very circumstance of Pamphilus never having left the stage ἶ
since the disappearance of Byrrhia. Simo is also represented as coming
on the stage homewards, so that Byrrhia might easily have followed him ³
along the street: and it is evident that Byrrhia does not allude to Pam- i
philus, from the-agreeable surprise which he expresses on seeing him ὲ
there so opportunely for his purpose. —— 3. Id propterea. Τ11ει pronoun
id, put absolutely, is synonymous with propterea. Wherefore some Ζ

be put for propter id. But similar pleonasms are common with the j
comic poets. — 4. Ipsum adeo praesto video. “ And Pamphilus himself ’
