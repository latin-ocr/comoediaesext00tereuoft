is apt to give way to fears and apprehensions, suspects that some mis-
fortune must have happened. Full of this anxiety and care, he is seen
here to come out of Chremes’ house, and looking round him, if possibly
he might discover the servants coming back. Clitipho follows imme-
diately aster, and cautious him to take care how he exposes himself in
that place, lest peradventure he might be seen by some of his father's
domestics.

ACT ΙΙ. Seiam: 111.

This scene contains the unravelling of all those suspicions, of which
Clinia is so full in the foregoing. It also introduces a new and unex-
pected event: for Syrus, who had gone only to aecompany Dromo, and
assist him in his charge, takes it into his head, by the way, to go to
Bacchis, Clitipho’s mistress ; and, as he chanced to meet he'r at a lucky
minute, prevails with her to go along with Antiphila to the house os
her gallant’s father. They had contrived among themselves, that she
should pass for Clinia's mistress, and Antiphila for one of her maids.
All this is transacted without Clitipho's knowledge3 and, therefore,
