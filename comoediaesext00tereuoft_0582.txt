applied not only to things but also to persons. — 12. Et id impetrabis. As
sar as the son was concerned, the cause had been decided‚ and Judgment
given against him. But then this happened in the absence of the
father. Demipho might, therefore, commence a new suit in his own
person, with every hope of success. In certain cases, especially when
any mistake or fraud had been committed, the praetor reversed the
sentence of the judges, in which case he was said damnatos integrum
