tune. Thus the spectator is made acquainted, in the most simple,
natural, and unaffected manner, with what it is necessary for him to
know, sees thexplot by degreeS, and has his curiosity raised in belialf

1. Quanquam haec. It is a great missortune that we want the assistance
of Donatus in explaining this play. He has either left us no com-
mentary upon it, or, what is more likely, his remarks are now lost.
In him we often find the true reading, which had been defaced by
time, or perverted by transcribers. In this play we have no helps but
what have been collected from ancient manuscripts. That this is no
small disadvantage‚ appears from hence, that we meet with more diffif
culties, from the incorrectness of the text in this, than in any other of
Terence’s comedies. Calpurnius, however, (who lived about the year
1460,) made an attempt in some manner to supply a commentar-y on
this play, in compiling which he has closely imitated the style of
Donatus. —Inter nos nuper notitia admodum ἐι. “ Our knowledge of
each other is very recent.” Nuper, here, is taken adjectively. The
codex Bembinus has nupera, which does not affect the metre3 but the
former construction, which is common enough in Greek (ἢ rte-mov}
γνώρισις), is not without example. — 2. Inde adeo. ‘⁶ From the very

Amplius quicquam. ·“ Any other tie between ns.”

4. Tamen vel virtus tua, διο. “ Yet either your virtue, or our being
neighbours, which I deem in a manner akin to friendship‚ urges me to
address you‚” διο. Among the several chains and links that hold
human kind together, vicinity obtains the next rank to friendship.

Servos non plures. ‘⁴ No person has more slaves‚” i..}e no person in this
neighbourhood has more slaves than you have. Schmieder thinking
this contradicted by vss. 91, 92, would read, Servi cumplures, the words
tibi sint being understood: but Guyetus had formerly proposed Semi
complures. Menedemus, though he sold many of his slaves, according
to his own account, (vs. 90, seqq.,) yet did not sell all; those he re·
tained might be more numerous than those possessed by any individua}
of his neighbours. The common reading is Servos complures. ——-·
