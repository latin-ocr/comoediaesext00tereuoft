also “to bear with patience.” See Scheffer on Phaedrus, i. 2. 30. *²⁴*
23. Quae. Donatus and Ruhnken consider this a neuter plural for
quas .· ‘⁴ which thingsss‘ meaning the injurias. See· Broukhus. on
Propert. i. 18. 23. Perlet takes it as a nominative feminine, referring
to Philumena. -- 24. Sed magnum neseio quid, &c. ‘⁴ But something
serious must have happened.'' , ·

“’ 26. Haud quidem ,· hercle parvom, διο. “ Not so indeed3 but rather
something very frivolous, if you were thoroughly to investigate the real
cause.” -- Vero. Westerhovius interprets this by ἀληθινῶς, eoe veritate.
— Exequi. Διηγεῖσθαι, narrare, as in Cic. ad Dt'v. xi. 27. Guyetus.
Thus Phaedrus, iii. 10. 59. On which see Scheffer. Westerhovius ex-
plains it by putare rationem, cogitate meditari, as in Plaut. Mil. iii. 3. 71.
But Ruhnken and Perlet, inquirere, investigare. Comp. Livy, iii. 8.
— 27. Non maa-amas, &a These words of Parmeno are very intricate.
and perplexed. The natural order of the sentence is this: Irae, quoe
sunt maxumae, non faciunt interdum maxumas injurias. On this Donatus
observes: Itgjetriae faciunt iras, non irae injurias. Hence grammarians
contend for an hypallage, ἱ. e. an inversion of the sense and order of the
words, which naturally ought to run thus ε Νοη maxumas, quae maximae
sunt interdum injuriae, iras facia-nt. Faciunt here for efficiunt, gignunt.
But perhaps faciant here is equivalent to ostendunt, monstrant.- ‘⁶ Quar-
rels, even the fiercest, do not always argue the greatest offences.”
Madame Dacier offers an ingenious conjecture, that as Parmeno here
pretends to philosophize, and assume a character that did not belong-to
him, the poet designedly makes him talk in an obscure, confused, unin-
telligible manner. And, indeed, if we consider the whole speech
throughout, there is great reason to believe that her conjecture is just.
— 29. De eadem causa. He should have said, in iisdem rebus, because
quibus in rebus went before. But we must recollect‚ it is a slave that is*
speaking. Comp. Andr. ii. 3. 8. - Iracundus. “ One prone to anger.’'
This is said of a person who becomes angry for some very triffing, or
perhaps no cause whatever ; iratus is applied to a person who becomes
angry from provocation. — 30. Gerunt. For habent. So Plaut. Poeae.
iii. 6. 18. So gerere odium, Livy, xxviii. 223 inimicitias, Caes. B. C.
i. 3; simultatem, Cic. Epist. ad Att. xiii. 14; amicitiam, Cic. ad Div.
iii. 83 Nepos, Datam. c. 10. — 31. Quia enim. “ Because, no doubt.”
Comp. Heaat. i. 2. 14. — Infirmum. Supply animum. —- 32. Levi sen- ‘
tentia. “ Of weak understanding ;” or ‘⁴ unsteady mind.'' Comp.
Plaut. Mil. ii. 1. 51; Illost. i. 3. 15. — 33. Fortasse unum, &c. “ A
single word, perhaps, has kindled all this enmity between them.”
Fortasse, like scilieet, is sometimes followed by an infinitive. Comp.
Heaut. ii. 3. 117 ς iv· 8. 16; Plaut. Paen. v. 2. 44; and see Gronov-
Obss. iii. 9.

34. Abi, Parmeno, intro. Comp. Phorm. v. 2. 12. This was the
custom of the times: husbands returning from abroad, usually sent
a messenger before, to let their wives know of their arrival. Comp.
Plaut. Amph. i. 1. 403 and see Broukhus. on Tibull. i. 3. 89.--Hem .'
quid hoc est ? Comp. Adelph. ii. 4. 17. —35. Trepidari sentio. “I
perceive they are in confusion.'’ Trepidari is an impersonal, as in
Livy, xli. 3. — Et cursa-ri rursum prorsum. ‘⁴ And running to and fro.”
Comp. Ean. ii. 2. 47. -- 36. Noli fabularier. Comp. Phorm. iv. 3. 49. --
