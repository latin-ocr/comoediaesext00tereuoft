368 HEAUTON TIMORUMENOS.

peccati cognoscendi, “ I will suffer him to know what vice is, that, when
he has known it, he may learn to hate it.'’—7. Non ut meus. Schmieder
fills up the ellipses thus: Non talis pater ero, nt meus est.— Per alium.
Chremes had said in the former scene: Scitum est, periculum ex aliis
facere, &c. — 8. Ubi adbibit plus paulo. “ When he has drunk alittle
too much.” The preposition ad increases the force of the verb.
Terence is ful] of moral instruction, useful in the conduct of lifie.
We here learn how exact parents ought to be with respect of their
children. It is not enough that they give them good advice, and point
out to them their duty; they must also edify them by their example3
because the least failing here will not only destroy all the benefit of
their instructions, but give too great an opportunity for youth to
exert the natural bias they have of turning every thing they say ordo,
that contradicts their own inclinations, into ridicule.

10. Sardo narret fabulam. “ He pours his proverbs in a deas man’s
earS.” Aristen. Epist. i. 283 παρὰ κωφὸν ᾅδεινς ΟοῐῐιΡ., Hor.
Epist. ii. 1. 1993 Propert. iv. 9. 21 ; Virg. Ecl. x. 83 Livy, iii. 60. --- 11.⁴
Da mihi. Comp. Phorm. iii. 2. 47. —— 13. Etsi is quoque suarum rerum sat
agitat. “ Though he, too, has cares enough of his own.'’ These words
were commonly used in speaking of a man who had more upon his
hands than he could well manage. We find them also employed to

, describe a man full of anxiety, running up and down, and in aperpetual
² hurry. Comp. Quintil. vi. 4. — 14. Pudice eductam. Comp. Andr. i.

5. 393 Plaut. Cure. iv. 2. 32. -— 15. Potens. “ Imperious.” Comp.
Hor. Od. i. 3. 1. —— Procax. “Urgent in her demands.” Comp:
Cic. Coel. c. 49 ; Virg. AEn. i. 536. It comes from the old verb procare,
“ to demand pertly.'’ Comp. Hec. i. 2. 843 Tibull. ii. 4. 14·; Laur.
Vall. iv. 105. — Magnzfica. “ splendid in her mode of living.”—--‘
Sumtuosa “ Extravagant.”— Nobilis. Eugraphius interprets this by
ab omnibus nota. —

16. Tum, quod dem ei, recte ’st, i. e. Quantum ad id attinet, quod sibi
dari jubet. “ Then, as to her demand for money, to this Ι say right!³
Commentators are much divided as to the sense of these words. What
seems most probable is, that recte ’st is only a mere evasion, where he
is unwilling to give a direct answer. As Bacchis is making conti-
nual demands upon him, and it is not always in-hisr‘power to satisfy
them, this often puts him to a difficulty how to behave. He does not
care to own he has nothing, and therefore comes off by this evasion
rectfflst, “right;” which, though seemingly a consent, is in reality
just “ nothing at all,'’ as it implies no positive promise. Comp. Eun.
ii. 3. 51. Heaut. iii. 2. 7. Colman's translation is :—

“ And let her ask
Whate'er she will, she must not be denied.”

—— Nihil esse mihi religio’st. “I scruple to say I have nothing.”
Comp. Andr. iv. 3. 15. —- 17. Hoc ego mali, Sco. “ This is a'plague I
have but newly found.'' Some explain this of his want of mon'ey;
but it is more agreeable to the whole train of the discourse to refer it:
to his mistress, whose constant demands, and his being unable to}

j supply them, is a missortune he has but lately discovered. —— Neque
