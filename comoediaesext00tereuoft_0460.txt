The mild character of Micio is contrasted by Cicero with that of a
furious, severe father, as drawn by the comic poet Caecilius. Both
writers are quoted in the oration pro Caelio, in thea'composition of which,
it is plain that the orator kept his eye pretty constantly on our poet.
The passages from Caecilius contain all that vehemence and severity

which, as Horace tells us, was accounted the common character of the-
style of that author.

Ι once understood this passage thus, says Madame Dacier: “ Perhaps
I may turn him out of doors.” But on further consideration I think
the sense which I have followed more agreeable to the character of
Micio ; “ His mistress perhaps will shut him out ofdoors.’' The fond-
ness he expresses in this sentiment is very remarkable. He doesnot
absolutely say AEschinus’s mistress will turn him out of doors, but
‘⁶ perhaps he may be turned out of doors.’' He is so extremely partial
to his adopted son, that he thinks his mistress would certainly caress
him, even though he made her no presents. This expression sortasse
has an admirable effect, as is observed by Donatus. -4o. Fores

This is Micio’s answer to Demea, charging him with not knowing the
duty of a father3 intimating, that he thought nature not of so great
importance in training up children, as deliberation and prudenee. >Ar
real father may be often blinded by his affection, but in the-case of
one whose liking was founded upon the merit of the person beloved,
thererwas less reason to think that he would be biassed by passion3 and
that, therefore, he could judge of his behaviour without prejudicffi aad
