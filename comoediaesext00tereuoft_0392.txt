Phor or THE HEAUTON Tmommnuos.

Chremes gives orders to his wife, that if she should be delivered of
a girl, she should immediately destroy it. Sostrata, however, being
delivered of a girl, could not bear to take away its life, but gave it to a
certain poor woman of Corinth, named Philtera, to be exposed3 and
through a piece of female superstition, took a ring from her finger,
and ordered it to be exposed together with the child. By means of this
ring the girl was afterwards saved, and came to be known by her
relations. The old woman receives the child, names her Antiphila,
and educates her as her own. When she was grown up, and believed
by every one to be this old woman's daughter, Clinia, the son of
Menedemus, fell desperately in love with her, and lived with her as his
wife 3 which, when his father knew, he took it so ill, that by constantly
chiding his son, he compelled him to fly into Asia, to serve in the
wars under the king of Persia„ Then he, who had been so uneasy at
his son's love, began to be much more uneasy at his absence.
Therefore, to punish himself for his over severity, he sells his house,
furniture‚ and slaves, except such as might be useful to him for
labouring in the country, and purchases a large farm, and, from morning
till night, not only keeps his servants employed, but also fatigues
himself beyond all bounds, though now in his sixtieth year. After
Clinia’s departure, Philtera, the reputed mother of Antiphila, died.
Clinia, after an absence of three months, no longer able to support *the
impatience of not seeing his mistress, returns, but not daring to appear
before his father, as dreading his former severity, he is entertained by
Clitipho, the son of Chremes, with whom he had lived in the greatest
friendship from a child. Clitipho, overj0yed at his companion’s return,
though it was now late, sends Syrus and Dromo, two slaves, into the city,
to bring Antiphila to her lover. That very day Menedemus had dis--
covered to Chremes, how desirous he was to have his son come back,
insomuch, that at first, Chremes, when he understood that Clinia was
returned, thought of sending immediately to let his-father know. ›How-
ever, he delayed till next day, because Syrus thought it would answer
better. This Syrus was a slave of great cunning, and a daring temper,
who being sent for Antiphila, brought also Bacchis along with him.
She was a courtezan of a bold, haughty‚ and expensive disposition,
with whom Clitipho had some time before fallen in love. Now, to
conceal the matter from Chremes, they concert this project, that⁴Bacchis
should pass for Clinia’s mistress, and Antiphila for one of her maida.
Next day, early in the morning, Chremes goes over to Menedemus,
and tells him of his son's arrival. He, almost transported with joy,
wants to see and embrace his son immediately, and give him the 'full
possession of all he had. But Chremes counsels him to beware of
doing any thing rashly, for by these means, says he, you will ruin both
him, yourself, and your fortune ; and at the same time recounts the in-
conveniences that might happen, if he discovered himself to be of too
soft and easy a disposition3 for that Clinia's mistress, whom he
fancied to be Bacchis, was not in a mean condition, or to be satisfied
with a little, as formerly, but expensive, glittering with Jewels and gold,
and attended by a numerous crowd of servants. One single night, says he,
has almost reduced me to want; and it will be vain in you to fancy that
