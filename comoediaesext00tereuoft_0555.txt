ACT V. Serme IV.

In this scene Pamphilus appears coming along with Parmeno, and
anthe time in close conversation. Bacchis, by mentioning the cir-
cumstance of the ring, and desiring him to acquaint his master with
it, sent a sufficient hint to Pamphilus, to enable him to comprehend
anthat had passed. We find that he accordingly does so: but the
discovery is so unexpected, and at the same time so fortunate, that he
can scarcely prevail with himself to believe it true. We find him, there—
fore, again and again questioning Parmeno, running over minutely
every particular, that he may be satisfied in all circumstances, and not
be blindly led into a false joy. But when, after due inquiry, he finds
that he can no longer question the truth of what had been told him, he
abandons himself to all that excess of joy and transport, which would
naturally flow in upon a mind raised from a state of despondency to
that very point of felicity it above all things coveted. ᾗ

This scene is a mixture of various Trochaics and Iambics. Verses
1 and 7 are Tetrameter Trochaics Acatalecti03 verses 2-6, 8, 9, 11,
12, 29—34‚ 39, 40, Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic; vs. 10, a Dimeter
Iambic; vss. 14-18, Trimeter Iambics3 vss.13, 19-28, and 35—38,
Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic.

1. Vide, ὅτε. [Enter at a distance Pamphilus and Parmeno] Vide
for cura or cave. Comp. Andr. iv. 3. 21. —Etiam. Ruhnken thinks this
put for etiam atque etiam. Comp. Plaut. Most. ii. 2. 43.-—-Certa et
clara. These words are often joined, as in Hor. Sat. ii. 6. 273 Livy,
i. 183 xxii. 30. — 2. Ne me, διο. Constr. Ne me pellicias frui hoc falso
gaudio in breve tempus. Frui for ad fruendum. Comp. iii. 2. 10. See
Perizon. on Sanct. Min. iv. 6. ——3. Visum est. “ Ι have taken car-e.'’
In answer to vide, vs. 1. —Deus sum. Comp. Andr. v. 5. 4.- 4.
Timeo, ne, &c. “ Ι fear, I think one thing, while you relate another.'’
— 5. Dixe. F or dixisse. —Invenissa For cognovisse. Comp. v. 3. 32.
-6. Suum annulum. Comp. iv. 1. 59.—-Factam. Comp. Eun. v. 2.
12. -Ei in this verse is a monosyllable. — 8. Quis me est fortunatior ?
Comp. Heaut. ii. 3. 55.— Venus-tatis plenior, For felicior. Venustus
properly signifies ‘⁴ felicity in love affairs.'’ Comp. Andr. i. 5. 10.

9. Quid donem ? quid ? quid ? Terence is very happy here in
painting the transports of joy, into which Pamphilus is thrown, by the
good news Parmeno had brought him. He expresses his gratitude to
the messenger, and promises to reward him ; but at the same time his
mind is too full to fix upon any thing—10. Nihil enim. “Why,
nothing.” We have here strongly painted the character of a servant,
eurious, inquisitive, and using all the little artifices he can, to come at
a secret, which was so industriously kept from him. For this he would
have sacrificed all his hopes of a reward.- 12. Qui ab orco, &c. A
similar sentiment occurs in Ovid‚ Trist. v. 9. 19. Comp. Florus, ii. 6 3
Cic. Rea. in Sen. c. 9. The Greeks say, ἐξ ᾅδου ἀναβεβηκέναι. - Redu-
cemseceris. Comp. Heaut. ii. 4. 18.
