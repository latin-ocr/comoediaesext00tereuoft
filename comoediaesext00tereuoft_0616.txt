“The third figure is copied from a mutilated marble containing a
Greek inscription, KAT. ΠΡΟ. ΙΖ. ΚΑΛ. ΑΠΡῙΛῙΩΝ, which inseri-p·-
tion, as it records no name, nor bears any other mark of those used
on funeral occasions, Ficoroni supposes to be intended to record nome
theatrica] exhibition on the time there mentioned, which was seventeen
days before the calends of April, being equal to our sixteenth of March,
and the time of the celebration of the Liberalia, or games in honour
of Bacchus, in ancient Rome.

“The flutes in the hands of the pastoral minstrel have but three
stops, but that in the right-hand of the mutilated figure has seven;
which confirms the observation of the learned Montfaucon, who tells
us that the flute had at first three holes, but that they were afterwards
increased to seven, and even to ten. In another part of Ficoroni's
book is a figure, which seems to be that of a vain-glorious soldier-a
very common character in the comedies of the ancients-—singing to a
minstrel playing on double flutes, which by their shape and size seem
to have been those large trumpet-toned instruments in use in the days
of Horace.

“As to the manner in which these flutes were used, Fic‘oroni observes
³ from Diomedes the grammarian, that by flutes equal or unequal, was
meant, that in soliloquy the minstrel blew only one pipe, and in
dialogue both. The prefaces of Donatus to the several plays of our
author do, Ι think, plainly overthrow this asserti0n3 and on the same
authority we may pronounce it to be pretty certain, that the solilo-
quies, like the airs in our opera, had more laboured accompaniments
than the dialogue, or common recitative: for Donatus has informed
us, DwnnmA histriones pronuntiabant ; CAN'rch vero temperabantur
modis non a poeta, sed a perito artis music-ce factis, διο. The impert of
this passage is explained by Diomedes, who tells us, that Diverbia
signifies ‘ the Dialogue‚‘ and Cantica ‘ the Soliloquiesss Of this
technical sense of the word Canticum, after consulting and carefully
comparing many other passages of Donatus, Ι am well eonvinced;
though I confess I was not at all aware of it at first3 nor, it is evident,
was Madame Dacier, who has also, in her account of the music, in
the notes to the Andria, mistaken the meaning of flutes equa} or un-
equal, right-handed or left-handed, supposing them synonymous tenum
whereas it is plain from Donatus, as well as from the title to that play,
that it was acted to equa] flutes, right-handed and left-handed3 and
that the right—handed signified those used in the more serious parts of
the comedy, and the left-handed those used in the more pleasant.

‘⁴ It appears also, from} the lines above cited from Horace, that the
minstrel did not content himself with playing on the flutes, but accom-
panied his music with some gesture suitable to the action of the scene.
Epist. ad Pis. 214.

“ Donatus has left us no explanation of the use of the ιξῗρφανεε and
impares. My friend Mr. Burney, a very ingenious master music, con-
jectures, and, Ι think, very happily, that the equal flutes were flutes in
anison with each other, and the unequal fimes, flutes in octave to each
other ε the octave resembling unity so much, that an uncultivated ear
can scarcely distinguish between them 3 as is the case when a man aad
woman sing the same air or melody together, at which time it seems
as if they were singing in unison, whereas the male voice moves an
octave below that of the female. Now it is well known in harmonice,
