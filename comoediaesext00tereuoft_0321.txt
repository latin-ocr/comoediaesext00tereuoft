ACT V. Sennis 11.1

Davus, at the end of the last act, had gone in with Crito to Glyce-
rium, because he did not wish to be seen by the old man. There we
are to understand, that the conversation had turned upon Glycerium’s
parents, and whether she had found them. Crito relates before Davus
the circumstance of her having been shipwrecked at Andros, and the

from the house of Glycerium. The poet conducts with wonderful art
and judgment this appearance of Davus. He comes out with an air'
of triumph and assurance, as now confident that there is no further
danger. By this means his reverse of fortune appears the greater, and
more strongly touches the imagination of the reader.

Davus, by noster, tacitly insinuates that Glycerium was found to be the
daughter of Chremes. This, however, does not appear till towards the
end os the fourth scene3 nor could Davus, at present, have the least
apprehension of it. As he knew he had been seen coming out from
Glycerium, he means to soften them by this little piece of dissimulation,
