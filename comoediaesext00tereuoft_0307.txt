Aer iv. scENE 1. 269

'presently.” Dispicere properly signifies “to discern:” hence meta-
· phorioally, “to devise.”

18.·Praecavere mihi me, haud te ulcisci, sinit. “Time warns me to

look only to myself, nor suffers me to be revenged onyou.” The verb
sinit refers only to ulcisci ,· monet must be supplied to praecavere. In
general, when two verbs are wanted, whereof one denies and the other
affirms, or o'ne commands and the other forbids, the first is for the
⁴most part omitted. ·We have an example of this in Phaedrus, iv. 17.
31. Non veto dimitti, verum cruciari fame. Here jubeo must be
·sup lied. A· remarkable one also in 1 Tim. iv. 3 : Κωλυόντων γαμεῖν,
ἄπεχε-σθαι βρωμάτων. Supply κελευόντων. Forbc'dding to marry, and
commanding to abs'tain srom ments. See Gronov. Obss. iv. 2. p. 26;

Characters too faintly drawn, says Diderot‚ are the opposite of carica-
ture. Pamphilus in the Andrian is to my mind a faint character.
Davus has precipitated him into a marriage that he abhors. His
mistress has just been delivered. He has a hundred reasons to be out
of humour ε yet he takes all in good part. On this Colman remarks,—
“I cannot think-thereis much justice in the above observation. Pam-
philus appears to me to have all the feelings of an amiable and ingenuous
mind. There is‘an' observation of Donatus on Simo’s observing to
Davus, at the end of the second act, that his son appeared to him to be
rather melancholy‚ which is in my opinion infinitely more just and
applicable to the character of Pamphilus than the remark of the
ingenious French critic. It has been reserved for this place on
purpose to oppose thern to each other. The passage and note on it
are as follow ε

ΙΙ. 6. 16. Subtristis visus est esse aliquantulum mihi. The propriety
os behaviour necessary to the different characters of the son and the
lover is wonderfully preserved in this instance. A deceit sustained
with great assurance, would not have been agreeable to the character
of an ingenuous youth: and it would have been improbable, in the
character of the lover, to have entirely smothered his concern. He
suppresses it, therefore, in some measure, because the thing was to
be concealed; but could not assume a thorough joyfulness, because
his disposition and passion inspired him with melancholy. So far
Donatus.

It may be added also, as a further answer to Diderot‚ that the words
with which Pamphilus concludes this act, alluding to his present
situation, assign a very natural reason for his subduing the transports
of his anger towards Davus. ·

 

ACT IV. ScENE Ι.

This scene begins with the complaints of Charinus, who accuses
Pamphilus of a breach of promise. Byrrhia‚ who in a former scene
had been sent to overhear what passed between Pamphilus and his
father, not knowing with what view Pamphilus had seemingly con-
sented to the proposal of a wedding, carries his mistake to Charinus,
and reports that Pamphilus was, by his own consent, to be that (lay
married to Philumena. Charinus,-not as yet undeceived, comes upon
