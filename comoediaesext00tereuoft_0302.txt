’ Simo, now persuaded that his son was disgusted with Glycerium, ³
imagines that every thing will go on smoothly, if he can but obtain the
consent of Chremes. He therefore represents the case to him, and, after ’
urging it very earnestly, prevails. This gives quite a different turn to ’
affairs; for as the obstacle, which Davus chiefly relied upon, was re-
moved, all his measures are at once broken, and himself exposed to the
resentment of Pamphilus, for having urged him to take a step that was
likely to involve him in so many difficulties. Thus the play becomes
more interesting, our attention is raised, and we grow impatient to see
how the poet will unravel the plot. Α

Chremes is a humane, natural, unaffected, old gentleman. Sealand
in the Conscious Lwers, the English Chremes, is a sensible, respect·-
able merchant. Both the characters are properly sustained; but ’
Chremes being induced first to renew his consent to the match, and-
afterward wrought upon by occurrences arising in the fable to withdraw
it again, renders his character more essentia] to the drama than
Sealand’s.

Of this scene, verses 1—4 are Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic3 vs. 5, ,
a Dimeter Iambic; 6—42, Trimeter Iambics; and verses 43—47, Tetra-
meter Iambics Catalectic. The last line and the first of the next scene,
form a Tetrameter Iambic Catalectic. 7

1. Jubeo Chremetem. Supply salvere. Jubeo for volo, or cupio. ³
Donatus says it is put sor vehementer cupio. -- Optato advenis. “ You
are fortunately come.” Optata, “ according to my wish.’' Similar to>
this is the adverb auspicato, ‘⁴ in good time,’ “happily.” Comp. iv. 5.
12. —— 3. Id viso, tem’, an illi insaniant. “And therefore Ι am come to
see, whether 'tis you or they have lost their wits.'' Id for ideo, οι· ob
εἰῇ-4, Ausculta paucis. “ Hear me a moment-’⁹ Thus in the Adesph.
v. 3. 20, the same words are construed together; yet Bentley puts ³¹3
colon after ausculta, and construes paucis with scies.

6. Per te ego Deos ονο. An urgent form of entreaty‚ where the natural ,ζ
order of the words is changed, and te or vos interposed‚ with particularg
elegance, between the preposition and its case. This is an imitation ⁰in
the Greek formula. See Porson on Eurip. Med. 325. ——— 7. Cum oetate 4
accrevit. “Increased with our age.’' Comp. Nepos Att. c. 10. See?-
Servius on Virg. AEn. xi. 537. —- 8. Unicum gnatam. Chremes had}
two daughters, Philumena and Pasibula. The latter, otherwise called}
Glycerium, had been supposed to be lost at sea. — 9. Cujus tibi, Sco.
“ Whose preservation wholly rests on you.'' — 10. Atque ita uti nuptia,
&a “And let the match, which should have been, still be.”-— l2.3'3
Quasi hoe, &a “As if you ought‚'' &c. τ’. e. “you ought not to beseechf.
this of me.’' Quasi implies a negative. Comp. v. 3. 19. There is anf}
inimitable beauty and justness in this answer, which Chremes gives tm}
Simo. Among reasonable friends nothing will be demanded but what-{2}
is fair and equitable, nor, when the request is of that nature, will there?
be need of many entreaties to obtain it. Chremes weighs maturelysss‘}
every thing he does, and immediately agrees to a proposal, when he 5⁸2³*-
convinced it is reasonable. But these parts of his character are marked}
more strongly towards the end of the play, where he takes so muchs}
pains to soften Simo's anger, and make him behave mildly and calmh}

5²³.
