Ut voluptati obitus, διο. “So that your presence, conversation, and
address, come where you will, bring joy and pleasure with them.”
Obitus means an accidental meeting, as in the street, or in public com-
pany. See Lambinus on Lucr. i. 223, 248.—2o. Morem antiquom.
Comp. vs. 18. Terence seems to have had in view a line from the fifth
book of the Annals of Ennius, quoted by Cicero, de Rep. Lib. v. (Aug.
Civ. ii. 21.) Moribus antiquis res stat Romana, virisque, &c. Comp.Plaut.
capt. i. 2. 20.—21. Ut unus omnium homo quisquam. There is an
elegant redundancy in this line. — 22. Tun' mi istuc ? “You, Bacchis,
tell that to me “.7” Westerhovius observes, that there is an emphasis
on every word here—Recte amasti. “Thou hast acted wisely in
loving,'’ διο. - 23. Nunquam ante hunc diem, διο. Comp. vs. 40, and

back his wife, without letting the world know what had occasioned the
misunderstanding between them. - 26. Ut in comoediis. Terence here,
with reason, endeavours to make the most of a circumstance peculial·
to his play. In other comedies, every body, actors as well as spec-
tators, are at last equally acquainted with the whole intrigue and
catastrophe; and it would even be a defect in the plot, were there any
obscurity remaining. But Terence, like a true genius, makes himself
superior to rules, and adds new beauties to his piece by forsaking them.
His reasons for concealing, from part of the personages of the drama,
the principa] incidents of the plot, are so plausible and natural, that
he could not have followed the beaten track without offending against
manners and decency. This bold and uncommon turn is one of the
chief graces of the play.—27. Resciscere. Comp. i. 2. 115 ς Andr.

35. Ego hunc ab orco mortuum? quo pacto! “I restore him from
death to life? how?” Parmeno says this, pondering within himself,
if possible, to find out what he was so impatient to know. He there-
fore repeats what Pamphilus had said, vs. 12 ; as there it was plainly
intimated that the news he had brought him was of the greatest im-
portance. — 36. Profiteris mihi. Comp. iii. 5. 13. —Ex quanta oerumna
extraxeris. “ From what distress you have delivered me.” Comp. iii.
1. 8. Some interpret extrahere by the Greek verbs, ῥύεσθαι and ἐρό-
εσθαι. On both these Ammonius remarks, Τὸ μὲν ’γὰρ ῥύεσθαι, ἐκ
θανάτου ἕλκειν· τὸ δὲ ἐρύεσθαι, φυλάττειν.- 37. Ego istuc satis scio.
