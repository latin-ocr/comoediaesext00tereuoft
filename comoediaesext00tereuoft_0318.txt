ACT IV.· Sann V.

I‘n this scene a new person appears, by whose means the plot comes
afterwards to be unravelled. This person is Crito, cousin to Chry-isa
As he was her nearest kinsman, and had heard at Andros of her- death,
he comes to Athens to look after her inheritance, which by law fell to
him. He is therefore introduced here speaking in such a manner as
gives us to understand who he is, and the reason of his coming to
Athens. Some think the fifth act ought- to begin here. ⁷

This scene consistsof» Trimeter. Iambics. >

1. Habitasse. N ot habitare ,- for Chrysis had been some time dead.
— 2. Divitias, A trisyllable. Comp. Heaut. i. 2. 203 iii. 2. 163 Phorm-
v..7. 79.‚— Optavit. ‘⁴ Chose.‘’ So optare for eligere, Virg. AEn. i>
425, Colum. x. 277. - 3. Potius, quam, &c. Here inhoneste and
honeste are opposed, parare divitias and pauper vivere, hic (Athenis)
and in patria. This antithesis is much praised by Perlet. For viveret,
which is approved by Ruhnken, many editions have vivere.. The con-
struction is the same as in the Adelph. i. 2. 28.. Sineres nunc facere
potius quam faceret aliena aetate. Comp. Caes. B. G.. ii. 10.’ Such a
variation of the mood, with ut either-expressed 01: understood, is not
unusual. —- 4. Ejus morte ea, &a “ By her- death those possessions
legally come to me.'’ Ea bona, referringto divitias, above. Some im-
properly construe ea with morte, and ejus with bima. -ε Lege redierunt.
,ι That is, supposing Chrysis tohave died without a will, in which case
her nearest relative was her heir-at-law. Possessions acquired by heir-
ship are said redire ; those obtained by will, venire. Comp. Hec. i. 2.
97. Yet we read in Cic. Verr. ii. 14, Huic hoereditas redit testamento..
Comp. Verr. i. 45„ The character of Crito is that of a worthy good
man, which appears at once by what he says in relation to Chrysi&
For· though he was her heir-at-law‚ and came to take possession of
what she had left, he is not so far blinded by interest, as not to con-
demn her for preferring riches got with insamy to an honourable·
poverty. — 5. Salvete. [Crito goes up to Davus and Mysis] -- 6.
Solu-inus. Sobrini were the children of cousins-german.. Gonjunociones
’ consobrinorum sobrinorumque.. Cje. Off. i.- 17. ”

8. Itan' Chrysis ?· “Chrysis is, then, no more 33' 'Bhis manner*
of expression carries with it a great deal os mildness and tenderness.
The-ancients avoided as much as possible the> mention of any thing
that sounded harsh and shocking to nature; and, where necessity re-
quired it, they endeavoured to soften it as far as they could. -—- Nos pol
- quidem miseras perdidit. “ She has, indeed, left us very disconsolate.”
Pol here is a short syllable. Itan’ Chrys. in the beginning of the-verse·
is an anapest. — 9.. Quid vos, &c. That is‚. Quid vos agitis ,⁹ quo pacto
vivitis ? satine recte agitis Ρ -— Nosne ? sic ut quimus. “⁴We ‘2 ·- as we'
can, as the old saying gooe, when as we would we cannot.” This, from
the manner in which it is here said, appears to have been a proverb. It
serves as an excuse both for their. presentand past way of life; and not
doubt Mysis had it in her mind to persuade Crito, that necessity, and
not choice‚ had compelled Chrysis to follow the way of life shehad
betaken herself to. The-same sentiment occurs ii. 1. 5, and in zeno-
bius: Ζῶμεν γὰρ, οὐχ ὥς θέλομεν, ἀλλ’ ὡς δωάμεθω- 10- Aiunt*
A spondee.
