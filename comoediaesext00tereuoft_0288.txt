Comp. ii. 2. 13. -- 15. Adeon' ad eum ? The preposition, with which f

a verb is compounded, is osten elegantly repeated before the case of the
verb. So, ad te advenio, vs. 19. See Broukhus. on Tibull. i. 5. 39. —
Quidni? Ruhnken’s interpretation of this passage, I give in his own
words : Quidni ad eum adeas. Nam si tibi sponsam non propter amicitiam
cedat, sorte ab ea ducenda deterrebitur, propterea quod veretur, ne tu
amore captus ejus moechus fias. — 17. Abin’ hine in malam rem. ‘⁴ To
perdition with you !’' Comp. Plzorm. v. 7. 37. —— Scelus. For sceleste.

20. Neque ad auxilium copiam. ‘⁴ Nor any means of affording you
help.'' Copia here for facultas. Comp. Eun. Prol. vs. 21. - 21.

[Pamphilus asida] ‘⁴ Would there had !'' — 27. Principio ut ne ducas.
“ Above all, not to marry her.” The particle ut here is redundant. —-
Dabo equidem operam. “ Truly, I will do my endeavour.” — 28.
Cordi ? “ Tomy liking ?'’ Things that are pleasing and grateful to
our mind, are said esse cordi, or animo. Comp. Phorm. v. 3. 17 3 Livy,
xxx. 17. -29, Prqfer. Prqferre here is the same as prodere, vs. 13,
“to procrastinate.” Comp. Hor. Od. i. 15. 33 ; Senec. Herc. F.
1893 Cic. Att. xii. 14.——Jam. A dissyllable here—30. Neutiquam
officium, &c. “ Ι deem it neither just nor honourable‚ that any person
should lay claim to thanks, who has done nothing to-merit them.'’
Liber homo here means a person liberali animo et ingenio praeditus, a
man of rank and distinction, one in good repute with his fellow·

citizens, a man of honour. In the phrase id gratioe apponi sibi, ³

the substantive gratiae is a dative. So in Cicero, id illi tribuebatur
ignaviae, and id tibi honori tribuebatur.--33. Reddidisti animum.”

“You have restored me to 1ife.” —Aut hic Byrrhia. “Or this ⁴
your servant.'’ The pronoun hic, says Ruhnken, added to proper Δ

names, signifies, that the person to whom it refers is present. Comp.

Adelph. iii. 4. 333 Cic. pro Ligur. i. 3.—-35. Optume. “Most ἑ
seasonably.’' Comp. iv. 2, 33 Hec. ii. 2. 4.—36. At tu hercle.

[Charinus addressing himself to Byrrhia,] “ But you, ,yousorry rog-ue,

can give me no -advice.” To hacid quicquam supply affers, or dicis, or ἱ

nuntias. —37. Nisi ea, quae nil opus sunt seiri. ‘⁴ Bne such as is not
necessary to be known.'' Some think this refers t011Byrrhia's dis-
suading his master from addressing Pamphilus3 others, tex-..what he had
told him of the marriage of Pamphilus with Philumena. Westerhovius
supposes that Byrrhia was whispering some trifle intu·his ear, which
