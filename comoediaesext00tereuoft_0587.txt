— Vale. [Exit Dorio. ] We see the character of Dorio preserved
with admirable uniformity throughout the whole scene. All methodn
are tried with him, but to no purpose; nor would it have been proper ο
,ω make him relent. Even the small concession which he makes ιε so
contrived, as to throw still more light upon his character, and show
avarice and selfishness m perfection. Nothing could have been more
happily imagined3 nor can we too much admireg the consummate art and
judgment of the poet.

 

ACT ΙΙΙ. scam: ΙΙΙ.

We see the perplexing situation in which Phaedria is left: he must
obtain the money immediately, or submit to lose his mistress. The
time allowed is so short, as to leave him not the least glimmering of
hope. Antipho, concerned for his sufferings, urges Geta to think of
some project for getting the money. Thus a new plot comes on, in
which Geta is one of the principa] actors, and Phormio has an oppor..
tunity of exerting his talents in Phaedria's cause.

This scene consists of Tetrameter Trochaics Cataleetic.

8. Dictum sapienti sat est. A proverb frequently used among the
Romans, and which corresponds exactly with that of ours, “A word
to the wise :” implying, that to one os Geta's sagacity and penetration,
a single word was sufficient to make him understand the business.
Antipho had said pater adest.- that was enough. Geta himself would
divine the rest, · that the old man was, if possible, to be cozened out of
the money. Antipho was not mistaken: Geta knows his meaning,
and proceeds accordingly.

9. Etiam tu hinc abis? ΤΙιε same as non tu hinc abis ? (Comp Ean. iv.

This question arises from Geta's manner of expressing himself above,
hujus causa, which seems to imply that Phaedria was one in whom
Geta was not so nearly concerned, that he should run any hazard for
his sake. Comp. Adesph. i. 2. 57. - 13. Sed parumne est, Sco. “But
is it nothing, that Demipho now rages at us all, unless we irritato.
