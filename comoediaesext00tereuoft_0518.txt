learn from him the particulars of the story, and the reasons of his master’s
acting so contrary ⁴to his promise, Philotis inquires, and with some
difficulty prevails upon him to make her acquainted with all he knowffi
By his account we are informed, that Pamphilus was, by his father’s
importunity, compelled to marry, much against his inclination. That
after his marriage, his aversion to his wife rather growing upon him, he
still resorted to Bacchis. But as she was become peevish and insup—
portable, and as Philumena behaved with great temper and prudence,
he by degrees contracts a liking for her, and neglects Bacchis. By
the death of a friend, which happens about this time, he is called from
home. Philumena is left with her mother—in-law. At, first they live
together in great harmony, but after some time, Philumena, pretending
a visit to her mother, refuses to return; which creates a suspicion that
some misunderstanding had happened. Matters‚ therefore, are at pre-
sentin such a situation, that it is uncertain whether, at the return of
Pamphilus, the marriage will continue, or be broken offi
