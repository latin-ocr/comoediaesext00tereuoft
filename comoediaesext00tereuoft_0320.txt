282 Annam.

a tone of discontent‚ as if he thought himself injured by him,⁸ in being
urged so much to what he thought must make his daughter miseraffle,
merely because Simo fancied he might, by that means, reform his son.
This gives rise to a very warm and interesting conversation, till Davus
is by chance seen coming from the house of Glycerium, which quite
alters the strain of their argument.

10. Simo did not rightly apprehend the meaning of the above general
accusation, and therefore has recourse to entreaties that Chremes
will persevere in what he had promised. — 6. Vide quam iniquus sis proe
studio. “ Mark, how unjust you are, through wilfulness !'' Chremes
had spoken hitherto only in general terms, but here he comes to give
the particular reasons for his refusal, that Pamphilus was so engaged
to another, that it was no less than giving up his daughter to certain
misery, to marry her to him. Prae studio, that is, propter studium,

15. Per ego te Deos oro. See note on iii. 3. 6. Simo still persists
in his endeavours to prevail with Chremes, and would, if possible, per-
suade him, as he himself believed, that all was no other than pretence,
to retard the marriage. His chief argument is taken from the persons
themselves, and the interest they had in doing so. And he adds, that
when once the marriage is concluded, all this will cease, because they
will find it vain to contend any longer. - Illis. Glycerium and her
