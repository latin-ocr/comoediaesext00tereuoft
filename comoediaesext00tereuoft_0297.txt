ACT ΙΙΙ. Scene I.

In the first act Mysis was sent to call the midwife to Glycerium. Just
as they arrive at the door of the latter, Simo, who happened to be
standing near with Davus, overhears their conversation concerning
Pamphilus and his honourable conduct. By that means he learns
what they had designed to conceal from him. At first he is greatly
perplexed, but afterwards suspecting all was but a mere trick to retard
the wedding‚ he applauds himself for the success of his projectS, and
the hopes he had of being able to defeat their measures. —In this
scene there are five speakers: one of them, Glycerium, does not
appear on the stage, and Mysis and Lesbia do not enter into dialogue
with either Simo or Davus. See note on ii. 5. 10. '

The meter is Trimeter Iambics.

1. Dixti. For dixisti. This is common in Terence. Bentley reads
dixisti, considering quidem as two short syllables. -2. Haud ferme,
&a ‘⁴ You will not easily find. ’' Ferme for facile, as Donatus
explains it. It would, perhaps, be better to render it“genera11y.” —

583 iv. 4. 17. Bentley reads this line thus:

Sl. Ab Andria ’st ancilla hoec. DA. Quid narras ? SI. Ita est.

Here quid narras? are the words of Davus, not so properly implying a
question, as expressing his admiration how the old man came to
suspect it, seeming to deny, or at least own it with reluctance. The
words Ita est are given to Simo, si hiifying that he ls confirmed' m his
suspicions. -4. Sed hic Pam. his is considered as an anapest
