command devolves.’' A metaphor from those who undertake the whole
management of civil or military⁴ affairs. Comp. Caes. B. G. iii. 5. ——
4. Tute hoc intristi, Sco. ‘⁴ You have mixed this mess: even eat it for
your pains.” A proverb applied to those, who were compelled to finish
*themselves what they had badly commenced. Intrita was a compound ’,Α
mess, prepared in a mortar; and consisted of crumbs of bread, milk, ’
wine, eggs, cheese, garlick‚ onions, and various herbs. In Ausonius,
(Idyll. vii.) we find: Tibi, quod intristi, exedendum est: sic vetus verbum
jubet.- Compedes, quas ipse fecit, ipsus ut gestet, faber. Similar to this
is the English proverb: “ He has made his own bed: he must even lie
in it.” —- Accingere. ‘⁴ Prepare yourself.”

5. Obsecro te, 8ιο. What Geta says in this and the following verse,
makes a continued speech of itself, and no way refers to what comes
from the parasite : Obsecro te, in te spes est, tu impulisti, subveni. The
same is to be said of Phormio: he is all the while taken up with his
own thoughts, and contriving how to deal with the old man. Two
things offer themselves to Phormio's mind. Si rogabit .· “ should he
question me” upon this affair, and desire that I would make it appear
how Phanium is related to him. The proper answer occurs to him
immediately. ¹ Eccere, (i. e. eece rem habeo :) ‘⁶ I have it,” I have ξ
found an answer for him. Comp. Plaut. Mil. ii. 2. 48. [Phormio “
goes on .·] Quid si reddet ,⁹ “ What if he reply ?” Sic opinor. ‘⁴ Thus
I think’' I shall be able to refute him. - Eccere. Festus considers
this as an oath, and put for per Cererem, in the same manner as ecastor
is put for per Castorem. —— 6. Quid si reddet? ‘⁴ Suppose he offer to
return the girl.” Thus Colman, Schmieder, and some others. Both
interpretations have been suggested by Donatus. Westerhovius adopts
the former. — 7. Cedo senem. ‘⁴ Bring the old gentleman before me.'’
Comp. Phaedr. v. 2. 4. — [restructa consilia. “ My measures are all
arranged.” A metaphor from drawing up an army in battle array.
Comp. Eun. iv. 7. 11 ς Cic. N. D. iii. 29. In Virgil, (AEn. ii. 152‚) we
have dolis instructus. — 8. Quid ages ? “ What do you mean ‘l'’ —-—
Quid vis? nisi, διο. “ What would you have me do, unless contrive
that Phanium may remain with her husband ?'’ Comp. v. 7. 33. —2 Ex
crimine hoc. “ From the charge ’³ of having married without his father’s
consent. —— 9. Atque in me, διο. “ And turn all the old man's rage
upon myself.” Comp. Cic. Att. iv. 33 Mil. c. 10; and see Lambinus
on Lucr. ii. 365.

10. Ο vir fortis. Comp. Andr. ii. 6. 143 iv. 5. 22. In this scene
Terence exhibits the lower order of parasites, who ingratiated them-
selves by sharping and roguery. In the Eunuchus he describes the
parasites of a higher rank, and of a newer specieS, who obtained their
’ end by flattery.— 11. Ne istaec fortitudo, διο. “Lest all this noble
confidence of yours end in the stocks, at last.'' Comp. iv. 4. 15. t
Nervus was a wooden instrument for confining the feet of criminals. It ἰ
was somewhat like our “stocks‚’' and was fastened on the legs with ¹
“ the sinews” of animals. —- 12. Factum est periclum, διο. “ Ι have
already made trial, and seen the track of my feet.'’ Manutius fancies
this a metaphor taken from dogs, in hunting. Others think it refers to
travellers, who having gone over any road often, are perfectly acquainted
with it, and know where to tread in safety. It may relate to the pre-
ceding verse, wherein Geta speaks of the danger he* was in of being·
secured in the stocks. Phormio answers, that he is an old stager‚ and
