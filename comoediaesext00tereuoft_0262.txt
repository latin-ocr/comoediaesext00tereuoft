daughter, named Philumena, who was of age; and as Pamphilus was
a young man of a very fair character, he desired above all things to
marry her to him. For this purpose he comes of his own accord to
Simo, and concludes the match. The old man, without ever com-
municating his design to Pamphilus, fixes upon the day for the
marriage. While these things are in agitation, Chrysis, becoming ill,

calls Glycerium and Pamphilus to her bed· side, joins their hands, ami
shortly after dies. An accident which followed upon this, first brought
¹ Simo acquainted with his son' s passion: for, going along with him to
the funeral, when Chrysis was laid out upon the pile, and fire put to it,

Glycerium, through violence of grief, seemed as if she designed to
throw herself after her. Pamphilus observing it, immediately ran up
to her, endeavouring to prevent her with an anxiety that plainly dis-

covered his fondness. The day after, Chremes comes to Simo, and
renounces the match; declaring that he understood for certain, that
Pamphilus was married to this stranger, whom he so called by way of
reproach, little suspecting that she was his own daughter. Pamphilus
is overjoyed at the news, and Simo as much disconcerted. When the
day that had been appointed for the marriage ceremony came, Simo
cunningly resolves to counterfeit the continuance of the match,
imagining that by this he should be able to form a judgment how his
son stood affected. For if he showed any reluctance, this would
afford sufficient reason to chide him, for which hitherto there could be
no just pretence3 if otherwise, he hoped that Chremes might still be
prevailed on to let the match go forward‚ and thus, by good fortune,
the marriage be really concluded. Meeting his son at the forum,
who was now quite secure, and never suspected his father’s design, he
desires him to go home, and prepare for his wedding, which was to be
celebrated that day. The young man, struck with this unexpected
speech, and uncertain what course to follow, is met by Davu& a slave
of great cunning and dexterity, who by this time understood the whole
project of the old man, and how Chremes stood disposed. There
happened to be, at that time, with Pamphilus, one Charinus, a youth
greatly enamoured of Philumena, who had often in vain essayed to
obtain her* in marriage. But hearing that she was that day to be given
to Pamphilus, he begs of him, in the utmost despair, that if he had

as the young man's, advises him to take courage, and leave nothing
unattempted to obstruct the marriage; and that, for his part, he also
will, do all in his power to prevent it. Davus, in the mean time, as
said before, coming up, counsels Charinus, now full of hopes, to go
about and solicit the old man’s friends. He afterwards discovers his
suspicions apart to Pamphilus, advising him to counterfeit a com-

pliance with his father' s will; for by that means, says he, you will
elude the well· laid snare, and give him no cause to chide you, nor is
there any ground for fearing that the match may go forward3 for
Chremes, after having once rejected you, will never again think of
offering you his daughter. Pamphilus yields to his reasons. But
this conduct had a far different effect from what was expected3 for
Chremes, after some entreaty from Simo, complies, and thus the mar-
riage is like to go forward. By good luck Glycerium was that very
day delivered, of a son„ Davus, being able to thinkof no other likely
