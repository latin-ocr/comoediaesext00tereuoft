—- 27. Suspenso gradu placide. “ Sostly on tip-toe.’' Comp. Phaedn.. , ’
ii. 4. 18; Senee. N. Q. vii. 31.— 28. Animam compressi. “I drew in ’ ‘
my breath ;” or, ‘⁴ I held my breath.” Spiritum repressi is used by
Cicero, de Orat. i. 61, in the same sense. Comp. Ovid, Fast. i. 425.·—

y Aurem admovi. Supply foribus. —Animum attendere. Προσέχειν τὸν
νοῦν. “Το be attentivel’ Comp. Cic. Off. iii. 8. The thing attended
to is sometimes added in the accusative withthe preposition ad, and
sometimes in the dative. Comp. Cic. Agr. ii. 153 Livy, x. 4.- 29.
Sermonem captans. ‘⁴ Catching their discoursefi. Comp. Andr. ii.
4. l. — Hic pulcherrimum facinus audivi. “ Here I overheard the most
delightful adventure.'’ Facinus, from facere, signifies either “a good'·
or ‘⁶ a bad action.'' It is more usually taken in the latter sense. Comp-
Heaut. ii. 3. 73; Sall. Cat. c. 20. Maximum atque pulcherrimumfaeimn
incipere. It may in general be rendered “an exploit.”

34. Somnium, διο. “ Nonsense! was she such an idiot as not to*
know her own father?'' Comp. Hec. i. 1. 9. -35, Esse. For subesse.
Supply cur ignorarit patrem. -- 37. Atque hercle, &c. This speech is*
given to Phormio in all the early editions. Bentley found it attributed

, Comp. Heaat. Prol. 10. -38. Inde. “ From the gynaeceum.'’—⁸39.

ἲ Hand multo post, δῖε. “Shortly after your uncle returns again ands
introduces your fatherss’ —— 40. Ejus habendi. “ Of keeping Pha-
nium.’' Comp. Cic. ad Div. x. 13. — 42. Quin ergo rape me. “ Come
then away with me instantly.” Quin igitar is used in the same sense
by Curtius, V. 7. Antipho is so rejoiced at Geta's news, that he
jumps upon his shoulders, and is carried off in triumph. This was Β· Ξ,
sort of stage trick‚ and was extremely diverting to the audience. We ’
are indebted to Madame Dacier for this remark. I believe, says
Colman, Madame Dacier has not the least foundation for this extract:
dinary piece of information; and I must confess that Ihave too high
an opinion both os the Roman audience and actors to believe it to be
true. —- Fecero. For faciam. Comp. Heaut. i. 1. 122.-— 43. Gaudeo.
Guyetus ends the play here, reading Plaudite for Gaudeo, and pro—
nouncing the remainder of this act spurious.

44. His. To Antipho, his wife and ,friends—45. Eludendi. ‘¹ Of>
cozening the old men out of their money.” —46. Adimere. Ἀναιὲόὲὶ
λουθον, for ad bucardi. —- Caram argentariam. ‘⁴ His anxiety about the
money.” This is explained in the next verse. Phormio wants to
ease Phaedria of the pain “ of applying to any of his companions” for
money to repay the old men, and adds the reason for his doing so. —
48. Nam idem hoe argentum, διο. “ For this same money, unwillingly
as it has been given to me, will as unwillingly be granted by the old
men to Phaedria: but I have found a way to force them to it.” Pa-
trick says: “For though, perhaps, his companions may consent to
give it to him, yet it will be with reluctance; whereas I have found a ,⁴
way to secure it, without laying him under obligations to any one.” -. ’.
, - 49. Qui. For unde, or qua ratione. -—- Re ipsa reperi. Comp. »
