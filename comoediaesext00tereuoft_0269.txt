Aer 1. sanE 1. 231

The mette is the same as in the Prologue. This remark applies to
the first scene of all the comedies of Terence.

1. Vos istaec, διε. “ You, slaves, carry in those provisions3 away !”
[Exeunt slaves, and Simo turns and addresses Sosia.] The want of pan-
tomimic directions, however trifling they mayat first sight appear, has oc-
casioned, as it necessarily must, much confusion and obscurity in several
passages of the ancient dramatic writers. and itis a defect' in the MSS.
and old editions of those authors 1n the learned languages, which has
in vain been attempted to be supplied by long notes of laborious com-
mentators‚ and delineations of the figures of the characters employed in
each scene. This simple mode of illustrating the dialogue will be pur-
sued throughout these notes.-The·Pantomime‚ says Diderot in his
treatise on Dramatic Poetry‚ is a part of the drama, to which the author
ought to pay the most serious attention: for if it is not always present
to him, he can neither begin, nor conduct, nor end a scene according to

>truth and nature; and the action should frequently be written down
instead of dialogue. The pantomime should be written down, when-
ever it creates a picture· ‚ whenever it gives energy, or clearness, or
connexion to the dialogue·; whenever it paints a character; whenever
it consists in a delicate play, which the reader cannot himself supply;
whenever it stands in the place of an answer3 and almost always at the
beginning of a scene. Whether a poet has written down the panto-
ῐῐιίῐῐιε or not, it is easy to discover at first sight whether⁴ he has com-
posed after it. The conduct of the piece will not be the same3 the
soenes will have another turn 3 the dialogue will relish of it.—Moliere,
as this ingenious critic observes, has always writtendown the panto-
mime, and Terence seems plainly to havehad it always in view, and to
have paid a-constant attention to=it in his composition, though he has
not set it down in words.

Sosia adesdum. This long diseourse which Simo holds with Sosia is
well conceived by the poet, as it serves to explain -the fable, and give
us such an insight into the plot, as is necessary to make us under-
stand it. The whole too is so contrived, that we find ourselves in-
sensibly prepossessed in favour of the chief persons of the play, and
cannot avoid interesting ourselves in their fortune, which is one of
the grand secrets in this way of writing. -—-2. Paucis te volo. Supply

familiar conversation. Slaves took great merit to themselves in Ᾰ
being able to understand their masters at a single word or nod. —
3. Nempe ut curentur. “·Why‚ to besure, that the cooking of the
provisions be attended ἴσθ’ Curatio is a word proper as well to
cookery as to medicine. -Immo aliud. “ No quite another things·
Comp. Eun. iii. 5. 6.Ο —- Quid est, quod mea ars, &c “What can
my· art accomplish more than tliis for you. ‘²⁹' Ars (from ἀρετὴ, ’
“ virtue,’ ⁹) had various significations, and was applied to every “ quali-
fication.” See Sall. Cat. c. 2. Here it signifies Sosia’s “ qualification”
md skill in cookery. Efficere and facere differ in this, that the former
significes “ to accomplish” any thing, the latter to be employed in the
act of ‘⁴ doing” it. — 4. Hoc. Than cooking the provisions.
