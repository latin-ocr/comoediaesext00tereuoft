present. Terence could never be so absurdas not to guard against fall-
ing into so gross an error. He not only takes care to acquaint us with
the situation of Menedemus, but also with the hour of the day at which
the piece commences; which is plainly marked out by these words, aut
aliquid serre, which decides the whole point in question. Menedemus
having been at work all day, and being unable to see any longer, takes
his tools on his back, and is making the best of his way home3 Chremes.
at that very instant meets him near his own door, where the scene lies ς
the beginning of this play, therefore, is evidently towards the close of
the day, when Menedemus had quitted his work.'’—DACIER.

“ There is certainly a great want of accuracy in this way of reasoning,
with which Madame Dacier espouses Hedelin's argument: for why, as
Menage justly says, 'should the words aut aliquid ferre refer to the
manner in which Menedemus was then actually employed, more than the
other words, fodere, aut arare ? or if they were so interpreted‚ still they
must be applied to his carrying burdens in the course of his laborious'
occupations, while at work in the fields. One word of marginal direc-
tion, setting down the pantomime of the scene, according to Diderot’s
plan, would have solved all our doubts on this head. On the whole,
Menage, I think, fails in his proofs that Menedemus is actually at work,
though he labours at that point exceedingly: and Hedelin is manifestly
wrong in maintaining that the scene lies within the city of Athens.
One of the principa] objections urged by Hedelin, and referred to by
Madame Dacier in the above note, to the poet's having intended to ex-
hibit Menedemus actually at work when Chremes accosts him, is, that
the scene-evidently lies between both their houses. Were the scene
laid in town, as Hedelin contends, indeed, it could not be; but if in the
country adjacent, as Dacier agrees with Menage, why might not Mene-
demus be at work on a piece of ground lying between the two houses?
It is natural enough that the sight of Menedemus thus employed might
urge Chremes to presume, under the privilege of good neighbourhood,
to·speak to him. There is a brevity and sullenness also in the answers
of Menedemus, that seems in character for a man employed, and unwill-
ing to be interrupted, though he relents by degrees, and reluctantly
suffers Chremes to force his tools from him. His being at work, too,
forms a kind of theatrica] picture on the opening of the piece.--These‚
I think, are the strongest arguments, deduced from the scene itself,
which can be urged in behalf of the notion of Menedemus being exhibited
as at work on his farm ; and some of them, I think, appear weighty and
plausible: but a further examination with an attention to the conductos
the rest of the piece, determined, me to the contrary opinion. At the
end of the scene, it is evident that Menedemus quits the stage, and enters
his own house. It cannot be said, that he is prevailed on to desist from
his labour by the arguments of Chremes3 since he will not even accept
the invitation to supper, lest it should afford him a respite from his
miset-y. Itis plain, therefore, I think, that Terence meant to open the
first act with the close of day, together with the labours of Menedemus:
as he begins the third act with the break of day, and the coming forth of
Menedemus, to return to his toils and sels-punishment.'’-C01.MAN. ’
