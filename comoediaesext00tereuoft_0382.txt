ACT V. ScENE IV.

Parmeno comes walking along by himself, happy in the imagined
success of his plot. He recounts the many advantages that must
arise from it to Chaerea, and the great glory that will redound to the
contriver. All these sanguine hopes, this whole solemnity of prepara-
tion, paves the way for his heavier distress, when Pythias informs him
of the il] success of it, for he is seen to fall from the highest expecta-
tions into an abyss of despair; and so great is his fright, that he is
driven to make a discovery to the' old man, which he foresaw would
bring vengeance upon himself.

The first twenty lines of this scene are Trimeter Iambics. The
remaining verses are T etrameter Trochaics Cataleetic.

form of expression than quas res, but having the same meaning. — 2.
Astu. For the adverb astute. See Servius on Virg. AEn. xii. 694. —

Sil. Ital. xv. §Ha—Difficillimum. ‘⁴ Most difficult to be gained.’‘--5.
Carissimum. This, as well as its English translation, “most dear,”
is ambiguous. It may refer either to Chaerea's mind, or to his purse,
Parmeno, perhaps, took it in the latter 581188- 6. Eam. This is
redundant. Comp. Adesph. iii. 3. 4. —- Confeci. A metaphor taken
from gladiators. Comp. Cic. Cat. ii. 11. With respect to amorem
above, it may be translated ‘⁴ Ι have obtained.'' Comp. Andr. iv. 1. 15;
Phorm. v. 5. 11. Bentley and his followers read here—-

Nam ut mittam, quod ei amorem difficillimum et
Carissimum, a meretrice avara virqinem
Quo amabat, eum confeci, διο.

they are neat and elegant; and when at table with their gallants, they
eat most delicately.’' Ligurire signifies “ to feed nicely, picking and
choosing.’' —— 15. Illuviem. “ Filth.'' This comes from the negative

above. — Sordes. “ Meanness.” — 16. Quam inhonestae solae sint domi.
“ How disgusting they are when at home by themselves.’' Domi and
