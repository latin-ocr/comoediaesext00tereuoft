a,nd the more effectually to gain upon him, complies with all his
humours. AEschinus is pleased, admires the expedient he proposes
for the more conveniently transferring the bride, and commende him
as the best of fathers. Hence we have a lesson how ungrateful censure
is to youth, how agreeable flattery and indulgence, for by means of

this last, we may insensibly possess ourselves of their passions, and
wind them which way we will.

The metre of this scene is Trimeter Iambic.

others, think Babylo refers to Micio, whom Demea styles a Babylonian,
on account of his riches and luxury. See Burmann on Sueton. Ner.
c. 36, and the Scholiast on Juvenal, iii. 221. But as this carries with
it the appearance of a reproach, and would be repugnant to Demea’s
design, who wants rather to ingratiate himself, we must reject it.
Others read illi Babylo, making Babylo a dative, and referring it to
Sannio. But Demea knew, by what he overheard from Syrus in a
former scene, (iii. 3. l5‚) that the money was already paid. Patrick
takes Babylo to be the proper name of a banker, in whose hands Micio's
money was lodged: and that the words themselves are addressed'to
