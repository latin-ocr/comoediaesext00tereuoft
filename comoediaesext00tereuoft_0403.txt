Aer 1. scema 11. 365

ωοηῆιεμιοῐ longer able to bear a separation from his mistress, and
impetant to know how she sared all the time, he returns, and just as
hmihhnding is met by Clitipho, who takes him to his father’s house.
OEhence he immediately despatches Dromo to Athens, to inquire after
Antip hila· and Clitipho, to oblige his friend, orders Syrus also to go
ἀοῦς with him. The impatient Clinia is rmeasy at their long stay,
and gives way to a thousand sears and conjectures. Clitipho had been
endeavouring to persuade him they were all groundless; and, as he 1s
here coming out, still continues his discourse to him within; but
seeing his father, he goes up to him, and tells him about his friend,
not knowing that he is so well acquainted with his story. The old
man dissembles, thinking it best that Clinia should be kept in sear, till ·
a perfect reconciliation should be brought about. He therefore
pretends to blame Clinia for so rash a step, and justifies Menedemus,
as acting from a father-ly concern; concluding with an admonition to
his son, to take example from his friend, and not suffer passion to
prevail against his reason.
