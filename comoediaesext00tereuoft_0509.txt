ACT V. Scmm IX.

This scene gives us the conclusion of the play3 and sends the
spectators away happy and contented‚ because all the several persons
concerned in it obtain the full completion of their wishes. We have
already seen AEschinus and Pamphila made happy, Sostrata and
'Hegio provided for3 so that the only remaining anxiety is for
Clitipho, and that Syrus be rewarded. The profuse, lavish turn that
had seized Demea, happily accomplishes this. Syrus had obeyed his
orders, and levelled the wall. He returns to tell him so; and hence
Demea takes the hint to propose making him free. It is done: and
to complete the happiness of Syrus, his wife Phrygia is also made free.
Micio, wondering at this strange change of temper in his brother,
inquires the reason of it: Demea satisfies him in a grave speech, and
at the same time informs him of the part he intended to act for the
time to come. But* AEschinus, though he submits, still anxious for
his brother, takes occasion to mention him. The answer is favourable,
and promises indulgence. Thus all ends happily.

The metre is Tetrameter Trochaic Catalectic.

l. Suo sibi gladio hunc jugulo. [Syrus to himeff:] “I soil him
with his own weapons.’' Syrus, judging of Demea by his former
avarice, has no doubt but the news of having destroyed the wall will
be cause of great sorrow to the old man. Hence he enters muttering
to himself, Suo sibi gladio huncjugulo. Bentley and others make these
five words the last verse of the former scene, and give them to Demea,
with reference to Micio. Suo sibi for suo proprio. Comp. Eun. iii.
5. 173 Plaut. Capt. i. l. 145 Cic. Amic. c. 3; Gell. v. 10. For this
proverb see Cic. pro Caecin. e. 29, and Erasmus, Chic. i. l. Suo sibi
here is a dactyl. — Quod jussisti. Comp. v. 7. 10. - 2. Frugi homo es.
“ You are a trusty fellow.’' Comp. Eun. iii. 5. 60 ς Heaut. iii. 3. 19.
Frugi is an invariable adjective. See Cic. Deiot. c. 95 and Juvenal,
v. 109; xiv. 111. ——3. Istunc liberum ? “ Him! make him free? '⁹ —
μ5. Ego istos, &c. Comp. v. l. 5.—7. Res apparet. “It is a clear
case, and speaks for itself.” [This Demea says ironic-any] — Et
quidem porro haec. “And besides these accomplishmentS, to cater
⁴ faithfully,” 8ῑο. Many editors join cum fide with the following line.
Ruhnken takes fide here as put for fidibus, with reference to the music·
girl. — 8. Apparare de die convivium. The force of this passage
consists in the words de die, because the chief meal of the Greeks was
at supper, and an entertainment “in the day-time'’ was considered
disgraceful. Comp. Hor. Sat. ii. 8. 3.-9. Non mediocris hominis, διο.
“All these are talents of no common man.’' The whole strain of
Demea's speech here is ironical, though it passes very well among
those to whom it is addressed.
