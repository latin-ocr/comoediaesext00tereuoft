to leam what is infamous and reproachful, and what, on the contrary, is-
laudable and praiseworthy. ——— 62. Atque ex aliis, διο. To enter into all
the elegance and beauty of this passage, the reader should compare it
with what Horace says upon the same subject, (Sat. i. 4. 105. &tz- )
where he evidently copies what our poet says here; for he makes his
father give him the very same instructions as those of Demea to Ctesi-
pho. —63. Callide. Comp. Andr. i. 2. 30.

64. Hoc laudi est. Comp. Andr. Ptol. 8. So hoc vitio datur. -65,
Ροννο autem. These two words seemed to threaten a long discourse.
Syrus, therefore, becomes impatient, interrupts him, and turns all he
had said into ridicule, by gravely 'applying the very expressions Demea
had used, to the directions he, in quality of head· cook‚ gave the ser-
vants under him. —66. Ex sententia. Comp. vs 17. —1'37. Ne corrum-
pantur. “That they are not spoiled in cooking.' ' Comp. Phaedr. 1i.
8. 21. — Cautio ’st. Comp. Andr. ii. 3. 26. — 68. Nam id nobis tam
flagitium ἐι, διο. “ For that were an offence as grievous, Demea, in us,
as it were in you to leave undone the things you just now mentioned.”
-— 69. Quod queo. “ According to my weak abilities.’' - 71. Hoc
salsum ἐι. See note on vs. 65. -— 73. Pro mea sapientia. See note on
vs. 69. ‘⁴ Ι too, according to> my small capacity, observe the same
method in instructing my fellow-servants.'’ Donatus thinks sapientia
here, is used equivocassy, and refers as well to the substantive sapor as
to the verb sapere,· for cooks are directed by ‘⁴ taste '’ and ‘⁴ relish.'’ —
75. Facto usus. Comp. Hec. iii. 1.47. ——76. Inepta koec esse. By this he
insinuates that Demea’s conduct was silly alsa—77. Verum quidfam‘as ἵ
διο. “But what could one do? as the man is, so we must study to
humour him.” Comp. Plaut. Most. iii. 2. 34. -78. Mentem vobis meli-
orem dari. To address this language to any person, is to tell him that
he is either a knave or a fool. Here we perceive that Demea maintains
to the last his character of surliness and rusticity. He will not answer
in the usual way, Recte nt valeas.

79. Ta rus hinc ibis? This interrogation is not made so much with
a view of obtaining information, as to give Demea a hint what he ought
to do. — 81. Is, quamobrem. For is, propter quem. Comp. Hec. 111.
3. 22. — 82. Unum illud. Comp. i. l. 24; i. 2. 50. - 83. De istoc
ipse viderit. “Let Micio himself look to AEschinus.’ ' An elegant
formula of refusing the care of any thing, and transferring it with indig—
nation to others. Comp. Ovid, Epist. xii. 211, · ex Ponto i. 2. 9. --
85. Trzbnlz's noster. 7 ',‘O,u6‹pv7xos ‘of our tribe.” The Athenians were
divided into twelve tribes, after the twelve months of the year; and every
tribe was subdivided into thirty divisions, alluding to the number of
days in a month. - 88. Antiqua virtute. Hegio is represented as a
man “of ancient rigid virtue, and the strictesgt probity‚” and conse .
quently dear to Demea3 nor would he be less revered by Micio, who
was naturally inclined to justice, and of invincible good character.
Hegio was, besides, their relation, and had lived in intimate friendship
with them, which gave him still more authority. No wonder, therefore,
if the remonstrances of such a man have great weight; nor would they
choose much to be engaged in a suit, where, besides the iniquity of the
case itself‚ the very character of the man against them must heighten
the odium. - 89. Haud cito, &c. ‘⁴ The commonwealth will not easily
be harmed by him.” Cito is used in the same sense by Cicero, Brut. c.
