Ovid, Met. iv. 258, and Propert. i. 12. 20. - Istuc recte. These words,
says Patrick, are generally 'given to AEschinus, though Donatus, in his
remarks, ascribes -them to Micio. The manner too in which he
explains them is very ingenious, as if he meant this in a way of
reproach to Demea, for adopting an indulgence he had so often
condemned. But it is more natural‘to think, adds the same editor,
that as AEschinus put the question to his father, and received a favour-
able answer, he makes the reply‚ expressing that he was fully satisfied
at the indulgence granted his brother.
