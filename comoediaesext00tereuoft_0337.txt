ACT Ι. Sex-:NE ΙΙ.

Thais, une'asy lest Phaedria, not knowing her design, might take it ill
that he had not· been admitted 'the former evening, had sent for him to
acquaint him with her reasons. Phaedria, though an ardent lover, was
too much discontented to make the first advances, and therefore, though
he had come to the door, he could not yet resolve to enter. Thais,
wondering what kept him so long, and fearing lest her late behaviour
had, by his mistaking it, provoked him too much, is introduced here as
expressing her concern on that account. At last, perceiving Phaedria,
she calls to him, and kindly chides him for not coming directly. This

soldier, and begs his assistance for the obtaining of Pamphila from him.
Phaedria at first, suspecting that it was all artifice, rejects her proposal
with indignation ς but after some time, sostened by her soothing insinua-
tions‚ he comphes, and resolves to go into the country till the time
agreed on is expired.

The metre is Trimeter Iambic, as in the former scene.
