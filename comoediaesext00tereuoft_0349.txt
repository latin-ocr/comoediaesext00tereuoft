were not at liberty to leave their station, except on the most urgent
occasions, Parmeno had reason to appear surprised at seeing Chaerea,
and very naturally concluded that it must be something of consequence
which led him that way. —- Custos publice. “ A guard placed there by

ACT II. 8anss III.

In this scene we have a new character ε a youth of a rash, ungovern-
able temper in love. As Gnatho was leading Pamphila from his
master to Thais, Chaerea, who was at that time upon duty at the
-Piraeus, chanced to see her, and suddenly struck with her uncommon
beauty, followed all the way to the street where Thais lived, designing,
if possible, to find out who she was. But meeting by the way with
Archidemides, his father’s kinsman, while he talks with him, Gnatho
had delivered the girl to Thais, and turned another way. Chaerea, who
had now got rid of the old man, is introduced here, looking round for
Pamphila, whom he had lost sight of. As he is venting imprecations
against the old man for detaining him, he sees Parmeno. A conversa-
tion thereupon arises, by which he is informed of all he wanted to
kn0w3 and a projectis formed between them of habiting him in the
Eunuch’s dress, and presenting him to Thais in his stead. Parmeno
hesitates for some time, but at last, in a manner compelled by Chaerea,

consents.
