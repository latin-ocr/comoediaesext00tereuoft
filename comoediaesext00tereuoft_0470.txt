Ctesipho had gone in to his mistress, but recollecting that if Sannio
was not paid off, he might make a noise, and the story come to his
father's ears, he calls after Syrus to caution him upon that head.
His manner of expressing himself, as Donatus observes, is suitable to
the character os one who had all his lifetime been bred in the
country, and, therefore, was too modest to use the word leno. — 18.

Donatus has upon this the following remark: Convortam carries some—
thing magnificent in the very expression, for it is a word peculiar to a
great train of attendance. Convertere se is properly said of one who
is preceded by some solemn pomp, as in a triumph: in like manner,
convortit is used by a general when he changes the march of his
army. In this, therefore, we see the boasting and vain-glorious
humour of slaves, when things go on prosperously with them.——23.

ACT III. Scmm I.

AEschinus, in one of his night rambles, had happened to meet an
Athenian virgin, Pamphila, the daughter of Sostrata, who, though
poor, was well descended‚ and had been virtuously educated. After
ill-'treating her, he happened to drop his ring, which Pamphila
secured, as it might afterwards be a means of discovering the author of
her misfortune. AEschinus‚ when he came to reflect on what he had
done, convinced of its baseneSS, resolves to make reparation‚ and
promises to marry Pamphila. Sostrata is introduced here, full of
anxiety for the approaching crisis of her daughter.
