that, in the midst of their narration, the very animal of whom they
were speaking, would suddenly appear. The sear this occasioned,
tied up their tongues, and prevented them from going on with their

ACT IV. 8anss ΙΙ.

In this scene, we have a second instance of the cunning of Syrus,
and how artfully he deceives the old man. We have seen that, after
parting from Syrus, with a design of going into the country, he was met
by Hegio, and informed of all that had passed between AEschinus and
Pamphila. Upon this, he changes his resolution, and goes to look for
⁷ his brother 3 but cannot find him anywhere. To add to this misfortune,
he meets a workman from the farm, who tells him that his son Ctesipho
is not at home. He, therefore, appears here, complaining of his bad
fortune3 and coming to his bmther’s, to see whether his son may not
have returned to the country, Syrus artfully contrives a story, to make
him easy in respect of Ctesiph03 and then, to get rid of him effectually,
sends him wandering all over the town in quest of his brother.

This scene consists of Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic.
