Caena dubia. This is explained by the parasite himself, in the follow-
ing verse. Horace, who takes frequent opportunities of imitating
Terence, has adopted this phrase in his Satires (ii. 2. 76), where he re-
commends temperance, and describes the mischievous effects of such
a feast—Apponitur. “Is set before you.’' An appropriate word.

ACT II. Scmm ΙΙΙ.

This scene is artsully conducted. Geta and Phormio see Demipho
at a distance, advancing with his train of advocates, yet continue their
conversation as if they did not see him. Thus Geta is overheard by
his master defending his cause with great warmth, and proceeding even
to reproaches against Phormio. All this with design to ward off the
blow from himself, and make it appear as -if he was not to blame in
what had been done. In the conversation that ensues upon Demipho's
coming up, Phormio, in spite of all his cunning and artful evasions,
appears more than once disconcerted, and in danger of betraying him-
self. There is great merit in this : the poet would not represent
knavery in circumstances too triumphant. Phormio, though old in the -
practice of roguery, yet cannot so far conquer the conviction of his own
mind, but it will, in spite of all his endeavours, discover itself by a cer—
tain incoherence and hesitation in his answers.

The metre is Trimeter Iambic. .

l. En unquam. [Enter Demipho at a distance, followed by Hegio,
Cratinus, aad Crito. He is speaking to these three lawyers, whom he had
brought from the forum] We learn from vs. 7, that he had by the way
been informing them of the particular circumstances of the case, astel-
which he puts this quest-ion to them. — En unquam is put for unquamne.
