great acuteness and penetration, he even owns how far he is superior
to himself in judgment, and how capable to advise him where, trusting
to his own understanding, he was likely to be misled. These compa-
risons, so much to our own disadvantage, are always irksome and
painful ; nor can we avoid taking a certain ill-natured pleasure in find-
ing a man, whom we had believed greatly our superior, brought down
to otu· own level, or perhaps to a rank even below us. This is precisely
the situation of Menedemus here. In every word he discloses his joy,
at finding himself not inferior to Chremes; nay, he frankly takes to
himself all the titles of a fool, dolt, blockhead, διο. that he may apply
them with interest to the other. The conversation afterwards naturally
flows from this. Menedemus is impatient to discover all to Chremes;
who is greatly surprised and shocked to find he has been so much
lmgssstelilisuggssne, the first 34 verses, and the last 14, are Tetrameter
Trochaics Catalectic. The intermediate verses are Trimeter Iarnbics.

1. Ego me, &c. [Menedemus alone] -Non tam astutum. “ Not
very acute.'' Comp. Adelph. ii. 2. 13. —Neque ita perspicacem. “ Nor
so very quick—sighted.'’ Comp. ii. 3. 129. — 2. Sed hie adjutor meus,
et monitor, etpraemonstrator. “ But this my assistant here, and prompter
and preceptor.'' These are terms borrowed from the stage. Comp.
Plaut. Pers. i. 3. 68; Phaedr. ν. 5. 13. - 3. Hoc mihi praestat. “ Out-

does me in this.’' -— In me convenit. “ Befits me.'' Comp. Andr. v. 4.
39; Cic. Verr. i. 49, — Harum rerum ‚· i. e. “ blockhead‚’' “ stock,''
‘f ass,” “ dolt.” — 4. Dicta. For dictae. For this change of gender see

Eun. v. 4. 48. —— 5. In illum, διο. “ None of them suit him.’'

-6. Ohe. [Enter Chremes speaking to Sostrata] Ohe is an interjection
expressive of satiety. Comp. Hor. Sat. i. 5. 12. - Gratulando. Gra-
tulare· properly signifies “to return thanks.” Hence gratulationes,
“public thanksgivings.'’ Comp. Cic. ad Div. xi. 18. — Ohtundere.

interim. [Coming forward.] Comp. iv. 7. 5.—-Illic. In the house of
Menedemus. — 11. Dic mihi, διο. Comp. iv. 8. 22. -— 13. Servi
venere, &c. [Stin laughz'ng .·] “ I was thinking of the cunning rogueries
of that slave, Syrus.'' Terence, through all this scene, discovers
wonderful address, and a true poetic genius. Chremes is represented
ln full security, altogether unsuspecting, and even greatly pleased with
the acuteness and cunning of his slave, who could contrive and
execute a plot with so much art, that Menedemus, though apprised‚
was not able to discover the cheat. All this is done with a view to
heighten his surprise and astonishment when he comes to know the
truth, and make him appear to the spectator in a still more ridiculous
light. -—- 14. Vultus quoque, διο. The meaning is, that Syrus not only
lays his plots well, but also teaches those who are concerned in them
to put on countenances suitable to the several parts they are to act.
For Chremes was full of the belief, that Clinia, however indifferent he
might appear, was enamoured of Bacchis; and that his desire of being
married to his daughter, was no more than a counterfeit to, blind his
father. Hence Menedemus, when Chremes begins to be convinced of
his mistake, retorts upon him his own words: Sed ille tuus quoque
Syrus idem mire finxit filium. Comp. Caes. B. G. i. 39.— 15. Id.

upon Chremes. — 16. Veterator. [Chremes still laughings] “ The
