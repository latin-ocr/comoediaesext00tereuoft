by cohibere, ne cognatus illam abduceret.

42. Causam dicerem. Dicere causam is properly the office of a
defendant, or his advocate, and not of an opponent. Perhaps we should,
therefore, read: adversusne illum, causam ut dicerem Cui veneram
advocatus?—— 43. Cui veneram advocatus? See vs. 12. Comp. Cic.
Off. i. 10. —- Sed quid ista nostra ? “ But what are these things to us ‘2¹'
Comp. vs. 10. — 45. AEschine, audivi omnia. Micio still preserves
the character of an indulgent father: he had tormented AEschinus
enough, and was unwilling to overwhelm him still more by the pain of
a confession. Comp. virg. AEn. i. 385. — 46. Nam te amo. Comp.
Heaut. ii. 3. 119. - Quo. “ Wherefore.'' Comp. Andr. ii. 5. 18. -
Curae mihi. Comp. i. 2. 49. —47. Ita velim me promerentem ames.
“ So may you ever love me, and so may Ι deserve your love.’' There
is great beauty in this answer. AEschinus is not content with saying
ita velim me ames, but he adds promerentem, signifying that he wished
to be loved by him, and to deserve that love. In such cases as the
present, ita is always followed by ut, either immediately or at some
distance. Comp. Cic. Divinat. in Caeeil. c. 13. -48. Ut me hoc delictum
admisisse in me, διο. “ As to have disgraced myself with this fault, I am
exceedingly grieved.'’ Delictum admittere in se is the same as delictum
committere. Comp. Phorm. ii. 1. 403 Cic. pro Cluent. c. 61. — 49. Et
me tui pudet. “ And through my fault Ι am ashamed to see you.” —-

50. Sed vereor, ne indiligens, &c. “ But I sear you are too thought-
less.'’ The whole strain of this reproof here is conceived in terms of
so much mildness, that Micio rather seems to be excusing his son to
himself. In order to apprehend the force and energy of this, we must
suppose that AEschinus discovers great confusion in his looks, as if,
from aconsciousness of his fault, ashamed to be seen by his father.
Micio, sensible of this, and unwilling to put him to too much pain,
puts on a soft, sorgiving air, to assure and encourage him. And the
poet has contrived to make this more powerfu] in correcting the youth,
than all the methods of harshness and severity could probably have
been. For vereor, ne, see note on Eun. iii. 5. 62.

51. In qua civitate tandem. 4‘ In what city, I ask, do you think you
live? ’' Tandem, ‘⁴ Ι pray you.” Micio begins his reproof in a very
grave and solemn tone. Have you forgotten that you live at Athens,
where a strict obedience to the laws is required ἲ But he soon changes
his note, and instead of exaggerating his son‘s offence, endeavours to
excuse and soften it. —52. Tangere. Comp. Eun. ii. 3. 82; iv. 7. 27.

yet a natural failing.'’ Comp. Plaut. Merc. ii. 2. 48. -54. Item boni.
‘³ And good men too.’' Comp. Heaut. v. 2. 4. — At postquam id evenit.
Critics observe on this reproof of Micio, that he makes choice of
terms peculiarly mild. Thus here he does not say postquam id com-
missum est, but postquam id evenit, an expression of much less asperity.
The first represents a thing criminal, and done in consequence of a
design laid and concerted beforehand; the other looks more like the
effect of chance, surprise, or some sudden start of passion. - Cedo.
