Hanc. Philumena. — 88. Ad exemplum, &ch ‘⁴ Forming a judgment
of the disposition of both by a comparison of their manners.'' The
manner of speaking here, says Patrick, is elegant and expressive, and
may be thus paraphrased ; Mores utriusque επ comparatione mutua oesti-
mans, et de utrisque ea· hac comparatione judicans. There is a good
deal of address in the poet’s manner here. Philumena is commended
for her modesty‚ good breeding, and patience. Bacchis is passed over
in silence, which as it is a tacit censure, so it avoids openly blaming
one courtezan in presence of another. It were a pity not to remark
here the fine moral instruction conveyed in these few lines. A virtuous
wife is always sufficient to reclaim a husband not quite destitute of
reflection. If sometimes he suffers himself to be led by wandering
passions, yet his good sense will at length get the better of these ir-
regular sallies; and when he comes to compare virtue and merit with
these tinsel allurements and deceitful attractions‚ that are osten but
too apt to infatuate weak minds, he will soon gain the mastery of him-
self, and recall his affections to their proper object. — Ad e‘oeem, here is
