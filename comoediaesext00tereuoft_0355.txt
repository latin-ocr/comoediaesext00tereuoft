Ac'r 111. soi-:NE 1. 31⁴7

The metre is Trimeter Iambic.

1. Agere. An infinitive for the indicative agebatne. We must
suppose that Thraso and Gnatho have been some time in conversation
before they make their appearance. Ain’ tu ? may, therefore, be
very naturally supplied. — 2. Ingentes. Cicero, in his treatise cle
Amicitia, c. 26, remarks on this passage :-—-“ It was sufficient to answer,
magnas, ‘ great) The parasite makes it ingentes, ‘ huge.' A
flatterer always heightens that which he knows the person whom he
endeavours to please, would have to be great.'’ Lucretius has a
reflection much to the same purpose, vi. 677, Maxima quae vidit
quisque, hoee ingentia fingit. — Laeta 'st ? To this question he answers
in the same strain, Triumphat‚ “ She truly triumphs.'’ —3. Id. For
propter id. Comp. Andr. ii. 3. 2. — 4. Triumphat. The parasite
designedly pitches upon a military term to please the trifling captain.
Triumphare signifies “to rejoice in the most unbounded manner.”
Comp. Heaut. iv. 2. 5; Cic. ad Att. ix. 16. —Huc proviso. [Enter
Parmeno .· to himseffi] ‘⁴ I come hither to watch‚” διο. Comp. Andr.
ii. 4. 1, and v. 5. 1. —- Ut deducam. “ To bring the presents.” — 5.
Sed eccum militem. This is said in contempt. —Est istuc datum.
Supply a natura .· “ That is a peculiar gift granted me by nature.''
See Bentley on Hor. Epist. i. 2. 45. - 6. Ut grata mihi sint. “ That
every thing I do procures me favour with all.” Comp. Heaut.
ii. 3. 21.

7. Adverti animum. For animadverti. “In truth, Ι have always
observed it.” - Vel rex. ‘⁴ Even the king himself.'' Vel is used in
. the same sense in Virg. Ecl. viii. 69. The king of the Persians was
called, κατ’ ἐξοχὴν, “ the king,'’ ό βασιλεύς. The Greek mercenaries,
οἱ “flumem οἱ μισθοφόροι, formed the chief strength of the Persian
infantry. This may be understood of Darius ΙΙΙ., who reigned in the
time of Menander. But as Pyrrhus is mentioned in this very play,
Madame Dacier thinks it ought rather to be understood of Seleucus,
king of Asia. — 8. Mihi agebat. Supply gratias. — 9. Labore alieno,
δίο. “Α man of your wit often appropriates to himself that glory
which others have obtained with a world of toil.” Some will have it
that Gnatho says this, turning from the soldier to the spectators;
imagining it impossible that the captain should be so absolute a fool as
not to see that this was mere banter. But there is no necessity of
being so nice. Terence meant the captain’s character as sottish in the
highest degree3 and that he had both heard what Gnatho said, and took
it seriously, is plain from the answer Habes. That Shakespeare was

familiai-ly acquainted with this comedy, says Colman, is evident from
the following passage :—-

“Honormumm Novi hominem, tanquam te. His humour is lofty, his
discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye ambitious, his gait maJestical,
and his general behaviour vain, ridiculous, and thrasonica1.”-Love’s Labour
βασι, Act V. scene Ι.

— 11. Quod. This does not refer to salem, but to the whole phrase, as
in the Heaut. ii. 3. 123. -In oeulis. Gnatho was about adding gestare,
when the captain interrupted him with Scilicet, “ certainly.'’ In oculis
gestare signifies “to love and esteem very much.'' Comp. Cic. Att.
vi. 2. Gestandas in sinu has a similar meaning, Adesph. iv. 5. 75.
Gestare for gestabat. - 12. Verum. “ True.’' Ruhnken reads vero in

the same sense as omnino, “ by all means.” It is a formula of affirming
