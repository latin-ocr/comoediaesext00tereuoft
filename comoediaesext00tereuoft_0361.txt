ACT ΙΙΙ. Seram: III.

The character introduced here is wholly taken from Menander, and
is that of a youth who had almost always lived in the country, and was
very little acquainted with the ways of the town. Thais had sent for
him to be satisfied whether the virgin, whom the captain had purchased
for her, was his sister, as she had some reason to suspect. This obliged
her to ask several questions relating to himself, family, and fortune.
Chremes, a rustic, unacquainted with the modes of the town, a character
naturally jealous and suspicions, fancies all this done with a design to
draw him into a snare. He is therefore introduced full of this idea,
and contriving with himself how he may best avoid it.

The metre is Trimeter Iambic.

2. Nimirum. “ Without doubt,'’ as in Hor. Epist. i. 14. 11. A
person speaking by himself is allowed to suppress many words, which
they who overhear him may easily, from the train of his discourse, sup-
ply. This beginning of Chremes, when the ellipses are filled up, must
run in some manner as this: Profecto, quanto magis magisque cogito,
nimirum intelli ο, quod, διο. - Dabit mihi magnum malum. Menander ε
κακόν τί μοι ,agra δώσει. - 3. Ita me video labefactarier. ‘⁸ I see my-
self so shaken from my purpose.'’ Labefaetare signifies “to under·
mine,” or “ overthrow,” and “ to drive one from his resolution.’'
