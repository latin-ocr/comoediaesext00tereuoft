Aca 11. scr-:NE 1. 249

ACT ΙΙ. ScENE Ι.

We learn from a former scene, that Davus went to the forum''in
quest of Pamphilus, that, he might tell him what had passed between

him and the old man. There meeting with Byrrhia, he informs him of ¹

the intended marriage. Charinus, who was in love with Philumena,
hearing this from Byrrhia, gives rise to the conversation in this scene.

The metre of this scene is a mixture of Tetrameter Trochaics,
Catalectic and Tetrameter Iambics. Verse 18 is a Trimeter Iambic.

1. Daturne nuptum ? “ Is she to be married '‘2” N uptam is a supine ’ ²
from nubo. Some MSS. and. early editions have nuptui ,· but incor- ¹
rectly. See Drakenborch on Livy, i. 49. —2. E Davo. This is the
true reading. De Davo, as some read, would signify ‘⁴ concerning
Davus.” — 3. In spe atque in timore. “ Floated 'twixt hope and fear.''
—Attentus. This word, says Patrick‚ is very strong and expressive,
as it is put here. ‘⁴ His mind was upon the stretch between hope and
fear,'' and attentive to every circumstance that could leave room for
conjecture either one way or another. —— 4. Lassus. As the. strength
and vigour of- the constitution is impaired by disease3 so the mind, ’
by a continued attention, is so weakened that it can hold out no “
longer. - Cura consectus. “ Overpowered by care.’' The new acces-
sion of sorrow, arising from what he had heard lately, banished
all future hope 2 he sank under the weight of his missortunes‚ like one ,,
wounded beyond a possibility of cure. Donatus on the Eunuch, v. 4. 6, ,5¹
says the verb conficere is appropriated to gladiators. Comp. Cic. Catil. .
ii. 11. We read conficior lacrymis in Cic. ad Div. xiv. 4 ; meus me maeror
conficit, Att. iii. 8. See Broukhus. on Tibull. i. 8. 39.— 5. Quando
non potest idfieri, διο. “ Since that which you wish cannot be had, even
wish for that which may.'’ The same sentiment occurs, iv. 5. 10. — 7.
Id dare operam. “ To direct all your endeavours to this consideration,
how‚'’ διο. See note oni. 1. 130. — 8. Quam id loqui. “ Than with
words like these, to fan the fire and blow it into flame.’' Comp. Heaut.
ii. 3. 126. —- 9. Facile omnes, &Q The original line of Menander is,
’ΤὙιὴς νοσοῦντα ρἂτα πᾶς τις νουθετεῖ. The following is also quoted
from Menander: Ῥᾷον παραινεῖν ἢ παθόντα καρτερεῖν. Shakespeare’s
Leonato falls into the same sentiment: but in this passage, as in most
others, the English poet has the advantage :

Η
Can counsel, and give οοῐῑιέἔξῗι to that grief,
Which they themselves feel not; but, tasting it,
, Their counsel turns to passion.”

And again in the same speech :

‘⁴ No, no; ’tis all men’s office to speak patience
To those that wring under the load of sonum
But no man’s virtue, nor sufficiency,

To be so moral when he shall endure

The like himself.’' Μ uela Ado about Nothing, Act V. Sc. l.

—103 Tu si hic sis. “If you were in my situation.” Hic in this

place is an adverb, as Bentley and Ruhnken have properly explained

it. Charinus, 1n pronouncing it, points to his own breast. Donatus

makes it a pronoun. — 11. Omnia experiri certum ’3t. “ It is my fixed

resolunon to make every experiment‚ ere I give up all· for lost.”
