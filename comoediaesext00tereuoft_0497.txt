As Demea, at the end of the last scene, is reflecting upon the
threatening situation, as he supposes, of his brother’s family, a fresh
reason occurs to increase these apprehensions. Syrus comes out
drunk, with great assurance and confidence, and commending himself
for having acted his part so well. A more provoking circumstance
could not have happened to Demea, already almost distracted at the
repeated debaucheries of his son, and the overstrained indulgence of
his brother, than to see this flagrant instance of lieentiousness‚ and
that the infection ran through the whole family. But it is the poet's

aim all along, to multiply Demea’s vexationS, as will appear in the
,following soenes. *

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.

l. Edepol, διο. [Enter Syrus at a distance, in a state of intoxication, ›-
and talking to himself :] “ Upon my word, dear Syrus, you have taken
special care of your sweet self, and played your part most rarely.’'
Syrisce. A form of endearment.— 2. Munus tuum. That is, in eating
and drinking. Comp. iv. 2. 51, 52. - 3. Abi. “ Well, go your way.’'
This also is a word of endearment and commendation. - Sed postquam
intus, διο. “ But since I have had my fill of all the good things
within.” Perlet joins intus with satur sum, in the sense of penitus.
Hoc adverbium, he says, pro vernili sermone est, ad plenissimam satura-
tionem indicandam. -— Omnium rerum satur. Comp. iv. 2. 52. —- 4.
Prodeambulare. “ To take a stroll abroad.'’ This, as Donatus observes,
is the language of effeminacy and affectation. — Illuc sis vide. [Demea
behind, arith indignation :] “ See there! a pattern of instruction P’
Madame Dacier renders it: ‘⁶ There goes a fine model for the training·
up of children :” for, says she, Demea regards Syrus as the master and
governor of his son, whom Micio had adopted. Patrick thinks the
words imply no more, than that Syrus was “ a specimen of the ruinous
discipline'' that prevailed in the family of Micio. Comp. v. 9. 53'

No elision takes place after the third foot in this verse. This is easily
accounted for, by the necessary pause between the speech of Demea
and that of Syrus. — 5. Ecce autem. [Syrus seeing him :] “ But see
there !” Comp. iv. 7. 4; Eun. ii. 3. 6; Hec. iii. 5. 53; Phorm. ii. 1.
34.-6. Quid fit? [Syrus goes up to him with much confidence.]—
