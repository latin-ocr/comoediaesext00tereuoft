ACT IV. scam: ΙΙ.

We are now to be let into the other part of the play, which regaffdfl c
Phaedria, and the manner in which the money is procured to redb‘eni ’
his mistress. We have seen that Geta had undertaken it, and now
learn the method by which he proposes to compass it. In confieri: ff.
with Phormio, a project is formed which the next scene flssly opens.
The ‘present scene contains the praises of the parasite. Geta had
communicated his design to him, and found him very quick at under-
standing him, and very ready to enter into it. This, as may naturally
be supposed, pleases him. At last he observes both the old men ad-
vancing, and expresses his joy, that he had two nOW, instead of one,
to practise upon.

The metre is Trimeter Iambic, as before.

1. Hominem callidiorem. “ A more shrewd fellow.'’ — 2. Venio ut
dicerem. ‘⁴ Ι come to say,’' ὅτε. Some for venio here read veni, but
without any just reason. See Heaut. iii. 1. 83. -3, Id quo pacto fleret.
“ By what means it might be obtained.’' Comp. Andr. i. 1. 22; iv. 4.
53; Eun. iii. 1. 30. Fieret for conficeretur, or confici posset. Comp.
Plaut. Pseud. i. 3. 67. — 5. Gaudebat. Terence is very happy in're-
presenting the real characters of men, according to truth and nature.
Phormio is one of those men who pride themselves in their dexterity
and address, and accordingly is here delighted at an opportunity of
exerting these talents. The imperfect tense is frequently used to express
some action, as going on during the transaction of another. Comp.
Andr. i. 1. 33; Eun. iii. 5. 39. -— Quaerebat senem. “ He inquired
after Demipho,‘' and wished to see him. — 6. Tempus. For occa.-
sz'onem: “ an opportunity.'’ Comp. Livy, i. 46. — 7. Phaedria'i. F our
syllables by diaeresis. -— Nihilo minus. This is equivalent to aeque ac.
— 9. Eo me esse. Supply ego dicebam.

10. Sed eccum ipsum. ‘⁴ But there is Demipho himself.” Comp.
Adelph. v. 6. 2. - 11. Pater. Two short syllables here. —Beum
‘⁶ Simpleton !'·' [This term qs reproach he applies to himseffl] Comp.
Plaut. Trin. iv. 2. 110. -— 12. An quia, διο. “ Is it, that Ι have got
two dupes instead of one ?” Comp. Eun. v. 2. 68. - 13. Commodius
esse, διο. Comp. v. 3. 31. The meaning is, if I cannot succeed in
duping both, Ι shall have a better chance of cheating one at least. ·-—
14. Petam hinc. Supply argentum. ‘⁴ Ι will endeavour to obtain it
from him, from whom I first intended.” A primo for primo, or prin-
cipio.— 15. Tum hunc adoriar hospitem. “ Why then I will have at this
new-comer.’'

 

ACT IV. Scarus III.

Here we are let into the project which had been concerted between ’

Phormio and Geta, for obtaining the money they wanted. Demipho
had before made the parasite an offer of five minae, to rid him of any
further trouble with regard to the hated marriage ς but they were aware
he would easily consent to give more. Upon this supposition they
proceed. Phormio seems willing to marry Phanium himself, if they
will give him a portlon of thirty minae with her. Geta is lestw tol,
