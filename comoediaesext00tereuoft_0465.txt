ACT ΙΙ. Scene ΙΙ.

AEschinus, in the preceding scene, had left Sannio abruptly‚ having
first alarmed him with an apprehension that he intended to stand upon
his defence, and assert the freedom of the music-girl. Accordingly we
find Sannio, when lest alone, reflecting with himself what is best for
him to do; and as is usual in these cases, he resolves to put up with'the
affiont, and rest satisfied, if he can but obtain his own. AEschinus, in
the mean time, was not easy; he knew the severe penalties he was
liable to, if Sannio prosecuted the suit, and therefore was willing by all
means to come to an agreement with him. For this purpose, he applies
to Syrus, a slave of great cunning, and expert in these affairs. Syrus
undertakes it, and is here represented as coming out from his master,
and talking to him within, giving him assurance that he will soon bring
Sannio to terras.

The first nineteen verses of this scene are Tetrameter Iambics Aca-
talectic, and the remainder, Trimeter Iambics. The final of atque in
vs. 9 is elided by the initial vowel of vs. 10. Comp. ii. 1. 11.

l. Tace. [This is addressed to AEschinus within] —Ipsum Sannio.
— Cupide accipiat jam saxo. “ He will eagerly receive the money, Ι
promise you.’' —Atque etiam, διο. “ Ay, and own that he is well
treated too.” —2. Quid istuc, διο. [Syrus comes forward, and addresses
Samia] It is worth while to remark here, how Terence varies his
style, and always suits it to the genius, character, and designs of the
person who speaks· In the former scene, AEschinus carries it with a
Ἀ “ h hand, disdains to make any concession to Sannio, and instead of
c ling him by his own name, in contempt denominates him by his
profession. This behaviour is natural enough in a young man, arro-
gant and fierce3 and who, no doubt, thought the only way to humble
his adversary, was to show that he undervalued and despised him. But
Syrus, who wanted to makeup matters, begins with a softer tone, and
addi-esses him by his own name; which was doing great honour to a
man who got his living by so sordid an employment ; for we find that

. this familiarity wasa mark of esteem and affection, even among people

of condition. Comp. Ean. iii. 2. 2, and iv. 7. 37.-3. Nescio qaid
concertasse. “ That you had some dispute.'' Syrus pretends ignorance
of the cause of this quarrel, as appears from the words nescio quid. —
Nunquam vidi iniquius certationem comparatam. “I never saw a quarrel
arranged more unequally.'' Comp. Eun. ii. 3. 64. This answer is
founded upon what Syrus had just said; for by the word concertasse he
Α seemed to put AEschinus and Sannio upon an equality. Hence, in the
answer, we meet with comparatam, a term drawn from the combats of

. gladiators, where it was the custom to choose out such as seemed to be

most upon a par, and match them together. — 5. Vapulando. ‘⁶ With
being beaten.'’ Comp. Juvenal, iii. 289. -— Usque. For usque adeo.
6. Tua culpa. “ It was your own fault.'’ Some consider these as
abIatives, and supply factum est.- but the metre will not admit it. ——
Quid facerem? Comp. Eun. v. l. 15. — Adulescenti morem gestum
oportuit. “ You should have submitted to the young man.” Morem
gerere is the same as obtemperare. For the use of the participle with
oportet, see Heaut. i. 2. 26 ; iv. 1. 22. — 7. Qui potui melius. “ How
‘could 1 do more than submit my face to his blows ?’' A person
