45. Pistrilla. “ A baker’s shop.’' - Exadversum. The same as e
regione, “right opposite.’' Comp. Phorm. i. 2. 38.—Fabrica. “ A
joiner's shop.” Comp. Lucr. iv. 514. It is observed by Theobald in
his edition of Shakespemre, that the perplexed direction given by Lan-
celot, seems to be copied from this of Syrus ε·-

¹⁹ Turn up on your right hand at the next turning; but, at the next turning of
au, on your left; marry, at the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn down
indirectly tc the Jew’s house.”—Merc}1ant os Venice, Act ΙΙ. Sc. 11.

46. Lectulos in sole, &c. “He has ordered some couches to be made
with oaken legs, to be placed in the sun.'' It was usual with the Greeks
to sit and drink in the sun. Syrus, therefore, being asked a sudden
question, is supposed to have sufficient presence of mind to give this
circumstantia] answer‚that he might the better impose on Demea. -472
Ubi potetis. Comp. i. 1. 37. —Sed cesso, διο. [Exit Demea hastily]
-48. Exercebo. Comp. Andr. v. 2, 23.-Silz·cernium. This was a
funeral supper, or banquet, offered to the infernal gods, and se‘t upon
a fiint: also a feast at funerans, made for old men, who were likely never
to see one another again. Hence it is applied sarcastically to old men,
who are fit for nothing but to be set down to such a supper. In
Patrick we find the following note: ‘⁶ There is great debate among
grammarians about the signification and etymology of this word3 but
I shall content myself with observing here, that it is most generally
allowed to signify an ‚old man that stoops as he walks‚ quasi silicem
σαπῇ-«εἶ’ Colman translates it “ old Drybones.'’

49. Odiosus. Comp. Ean. iv. 6. 16. — Prandium. The Greeks and
Romans generally had but one repast in the day, which was their sup-
per. The dinner here mentioned waS‚ therefore, an instance of luxury
and debauch. -— 50. In amore est totus. “ Is entirely given up to love.’'
A person is said to be totus in aliqua re, who devotes all his time and in·
clination to it, and to nothing else. Comp. Hor. Sat. i. 9. 2. —Ego

ACT IV. Scmm III.

Hegio, aster parting from Sostrata, goes to the forum, where he has
the good luck to find Micio. He aequaints him with the whole
business; and instead of meeting with denials, or evasive answers, as
he apprehended, is heard with great candour and compassion‚ and
obtainsna promise of ample redress. This naturally draws from Hegio
many praises and commendations, which Micio, whose character is
that of goodness itself, modestly declines. In this part of their con-
