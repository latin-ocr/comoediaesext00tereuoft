“ For when mischance befalls uS, all the interval between its happening
and our knowledge of it may be esteemed clear gain.” Some consider
nos omnes an accusative put absolutely. Madame Dacier‚ who makes
it a nominative, with Donatus, says we ought to supply sic existimare
debemus. Apollodorus = Οῖ πόνοι γὰρ μέλλοντες τὸ τοῦ χρόνου τοῦ νῦν
κέρδος κομίζουσιν. A similar sentiment occurs in Milton’s Comus:

“ Pence, brother; be not over exquisite,
To cast the fashion of uncertain evils ;
For grant they be so, while they rest unknown,
What need a man forestall his date of grief,
And run to meet what he would most avoid?
Or, if they be but false alanus of fear,
How better is such sels-delusion !'’

‘⁴ For duty obliges me to bear with the injuries received from my
mother.'' This is truly worthy a great and good character, as the poet
is solicitous to make that of Pamphilus appear. Compare by all means
Cic. Cluent. c. 6. —- 22. Tum uxori obnoxius. “ And then I am
under such obligations to my wife.” Obnoxius seems here to import
an obligation arising from gratitude. He supposed that either his
mother, or wife, was in fault. If his mother, duty obliged him to bear
with her3 if his wife, he was under so many obligations to her, for her
prudent and discreet behaviour in hiding his faults, that he knew not
