subject, it seems probable, that ‘ the scenic modulation‚’ as Quintilian
calls it, in comedy‚ was a kind of easy chant, calculated to assist the
actors in the declamation, and to throw out the voice with force, in
order to fill their ample theatres. Indeed the same critic expressly
tells uS‚ that the declamation of the comic actors was nothing more
than adding a certain theatrical grace to the manner of common con·
versation; not falling entirely into the ease of ordinary discourse,
which would be inarfificial, nor departing so far from nature as to
lose the excellence of imitation. Inst. Orat. ii. 10.

“According to Donatus, the right-handed flutes were the proper ac· 2
companiments to comedies of a graver cast, and the left—handed to ¹
those of more pleasantry. Montfaucon (tom. iii. part 2. p. 342‚) ob-
serves, that the flute took its original name, tibia, from being anciently
made of ⁴ the leg’ of some animal, as of a horse, a dog, διο. He
seems at a loss to conceive how a double flute could create an agree-
able harmony, but believes it to have been even in more common use
than the single; though he supposes that the two flutes were in fact
separated, but that the several pipes of each joined in the mouth of
the player. To this account he annexes the figure of a choraules, or
chief iniusti-el, who holds in each hand a pipe without holes, much in
the shape of a modern post—horn.

⁴‘ In order to give as plain an idea as possible of the music to the
ancient comedies, I subjoin the description of a plate containing three
musical figures, published in an Italian treatise on the Theatrical
Masks and Comic Figures of the Romans, by Francesco de Ficoroni.
One figure is that of a female minstrel, playing on two flutes of un-
equa! length ,· and is copied from a very ancient bas-relies in marble,
preserved among the curious pieces of sculpture in the Farnese palace.
The whole marble contains five figures, and represents a scene in
the last act of the Andria, where Simo calls forth Dromo to carry off
Davus to punishment. On one side Dromo, with a kind of knotted
cord in his hand, which is raised in the air, and seems prepared to fall
heavily on Davus, is hurrying him away. On the other side appears
the enraged Simo, with Chremes endeavouring to moderate his anger,
and in the middle the above-mentioned minstrel. The dress os the
minstrel‚ although a female one, is exactly conformable to the descrip-
tion of the habit of the minstrel of Horace:

Traxitque vagus per pulpita vestem.
‘ And draws along the stage a length of train‚’

On the marble. she is turned towards the two slaves; and seems in-
tending to keep time with Dromo’s blows; or, as Ficoroni supposes,
to exhilarate the spectators between the several blows.

‘⁶ The second figure in F icoroni’s plate is that of a female, bearing
two unequal fimes, and (as he supposes from her flowing hair being
collected in a knot behind, as well as from a satyric mask, which in
the original Cameo, whence the plate is taken, stands by her side)
represents a minstrel employed in the satyrio drama, a kind of serious
pastoral, much in favour on the Roman stage, and of which Horace
has spoken very largely. (Epist. ad Pisones, 220.) This figure seems
to confirm the conjecture of Monffaucon, that the double flutes were
in fact two distinct instruments, and that the pipes of each joined in,
the mouth of the minstrel.
