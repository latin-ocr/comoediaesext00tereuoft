ACT V. Serme Ι.

Thais, by this time, is informed of Pamphila’s missortune: and in-
quiring of Pythias, who is willing to palliate matters, is answered only
by evasions. Thais, therefore, comes here upon the stage, in a passion
with Pythias, and chides her for her shuffling replies. At last, after
some discourse, Chaerea discovers himself coming from Antipho’s,
where he had not an opportunity of changing his dress.

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.

1. Perpleoee. “ Unintelligibly.’‘ — 2. Seio, nescio, διο. Itis natural,
when one is angry with another, to repeat part of what is said by the
person with whom one is angry. Thais here instances in a few words,
by which we may be able to judge of the ‘⁴ confused and perplexed‘'
replies of Pythias. Westerhovius has attempted to give us the con-
versation of Thais and Pythias, before their appearance on the stage.
—— 4. Conscissa veste. Westerhovius doubts by whom this was done,
whether by the pretended Dorus, or by Pamphila herself. Comp. iv. 3.
4, where these doubts are dissipated. —— obticet. We cannot here pass
by without notice the remark of Donatus, as it serves to give some
idea of the genius of the language, and also shows how careful Terence
was in the choice of his words. Tacemus consilim reticemus dolores,-
obticemus quorum nos pudet. Comp. Virg. AEn. ii. 94; Heaut. i. 1. 33;
v. 1. 65. — 8. Qui chaerea ? “ What Chaerea ·?” Chaerea, the brother
of Phaedria‚ was unknown to Thais.— 10. Quid is, obsecro, ad me?
“What is he to me, pray ’.ν’ Obsecro, says Donatus, non rogantis est,
sed dolentis. It is a form of vehement admiration, iv. 3. 22.

12. Infelix. “I am unhappy indeed.'’—13. Num id lacrymat?
‘⁴ Does she weep on that account ?'’ Id for propter id. -— Opinor. This·
is anything but speaking frankly: she had said before, (iv. 4. 37,) res
ipsa infima—14. Istuccine interminata sum, διο. “ Was that the
charge I gave you at my departure ?” Comp. iii. 2. 52. - 15. Quid
facerem? ‘⁴ What could I do?’' A formula used in excusing one's
self. Comp. Adelph. ii. 2. 6; Virg. Eel. i. 41; vii. 14. —16. Ovem

knowing that the person she had seen in the party-coloured dress was·
the person meant by Pythias. — 20. Quantum potest. supply cito. So*
the Greeks say ὠς δυνατόν. - 21. Quid illo faciemus ? “ What can we
do with him, fool ‘2” Comp. Andr. v. 4. 34; Cic. Verr. ii. 16. A dif-
ferent construction occurs v. 2. 10. -— 22. Os impudens. Comn. iv. 7.
