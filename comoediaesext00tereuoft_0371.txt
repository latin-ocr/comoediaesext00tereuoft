Ac‘r ιν. semu: 1v. 333

13. Namque. “ Certainly3 for 1 had no other.’¹ — 15. Honesta
facie et liberali. See notes Andr. i. 1. ll ; i. l. 45; Eun. iii. 2. 20. —
16. Dudum. “ A little while ago.” Comp. iv. 5. 5 ; Phorm. ii. 4. 19.
—- Varia veste. “ In a habit of various oolours.” Comp. Ovid, Epist.
xv. 37. The variegated dress of Eunuchs is mentioned by Cicero,
Orator, c. 70.— 17. Illam. The variegated dress. —- 18. Quasivero, διο.
“ F or indeed you talk as is the difference were little.” — 20. Quem tu
videre vero velles. “ You yourself‚ who are so good a judge of beauty.”
’Tis worth while to observe here the address and conduct of the poet,
who, to give us the higher idea of Chaerea’s beauty, has found the
secret of making it commended by the person who was most incensed
a ainst him.

g21. Hic est vietus. “This fellow is bent with age.'’ - Veternosus.
“ Lethargic,'’ or “ sluggish.'' — 22. Colore mustellino. “ Of the colour
of a weasel.’' Donatus here accuses Terence of not understanding
the Greek of Menander, who had written αὐτὸς δὲ ἐστὶ γαλεώτης ’γέρων-
which he ought to have translated colore stellionina. i. e. maculoso, lenti-
ginoso, like that of the “ est,'’ or “ newt,’' a creature spotted, and not
unlike a lizard: and he adds, that this mistake is owing to the poet
confounding γαλῆ, “ a weasel,'‘ with γαλεώτης, “ an eft.’' I am apt to
think, says Patrick, that Donatus is rather guilty osan error here than
Terence, because both the sense seems to require his translation, and,
if we will be determined by Suidas, there is no difference in significa-
tion between the two words. — Quae Izaec est sabula ? “What strange
story is this? ” Comp. Andr. iv. 4. 8. —- 23. Eo rediges me, &c.
“ You will drive me to that pass, that I shall scarcely know what Ι have
bought.” This passage has been nearly copied by Cicero, Att. i. 19.-
24. Eho tu ,Ι [Το Dorus] - Jube, mi denuo respondeat. Pythias
makes this request‚ because it was not allowed to interrogate a slave in
the presence of his master, without having first obtained leave from the
latter.—-25. Venisti. [To Dorus.]—-Negat. Dorus answers in the “
negative by a shake of his head.

27. Expedi. “Explain.’' Comp. v. 5. 20. Phorm. i. 4. 20; Sall.
Jug. c. 5. — 30. Fraterne? Here is a defect of the synaloepha.—

hanc dedit vestem. “ Chaerea gave me these clothes.'’ —- Occidi.
[Phaedria aside,] ‘⁴ Confusion 2 '¹ - 35. Credis sobriam esse me.
Phaedria had said to Pythias in the former scene, vs. 13, temulenta
e's. — 36. Age, bellua. “ Away, dolt!” -— 37. Huic. “This fugitive
slave.'’-— Quid isti credam ? “Why need I believe him? the deed

quere hac. [Apart to Dorus] — 4⁴7. Ora me. [Apart to Dorus .·] “ Beg
