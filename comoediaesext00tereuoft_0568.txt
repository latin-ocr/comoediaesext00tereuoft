530 PHORMIO.

Had Terence written depecisci vita, the meaning would still he'the
same. Thus Virgil, AEn. v. 230, vitamque volunt pro laude pacisci] AEng.

—what pleasure you enjoy.” Et tu. Supply capias.—16. Utm.·‘11‘va·pv};
“Not to mention your good fortune,'' διο. Nothing can be more
naturally framed than the conversation of these two. Each speaks in
a strain adapted to his character and circumstances. Antipho, who
had compassed his desires, but sees misfortunes threatening him,
laments his fate, and envies Phaedria, who, though he had been crossed
in his wishes, had yet no fears to alarm him. Phaedria again, impatient
that his happiness was deferred, magnifies Antipho's good fortune, 'and
opposes it to his own, every way perverse and untoward —17. Uxorem
sine mala sama palam. “ An acknowledged wife of unblemished
character.’' These words, says Patrick, admit of a twofold-eon-
struction: “ That you have got a wife without any prejudice rto your
character.’' But this can scarcely be Phaedria's meaning, since, appa-
rently, the thing was otherwise. Antipho had married a girl of
obscure birth, and of no fortune. We ought, therefore, to take it as “ a
wife of unspotted reputation, and without reproach.” —Palarm The
reverse of clam. Comp. Andr. ii. 6. 13. Muretus joins palam with
beatus, i. e. “every one sees that you are happy.’'—-18. Beatus, πί

want a mind to bear your good fortune with moderation;” i. e. you
want a disposition to think yourself really happy.— 19. Tum sentias,

never to be content with our own condition.” To sentias, Paraeus

He had gone to the port to inquire for a letter, which he heard was
