and Gnatho speak in contradiction to the idea of Thais’s wonderful
veneration for Thraso, with which they opened the scene. — 58. Jam

character of Gnatho: Οἱ δὲ κόλακες τοὺς βασιλεῖς, καὶ πλουσιοὺς, καὶ
ἄρχοντας, οὐκ ὀλβίους μόνον καὶ μακαρίους, ἀλλὰ καὶ φρονήσει, καὶ τέχνῃ,

ACT III. Scmm ΙΙ.

While Thraso and Gnatho are discoursing together, as in the former
scene, Thais comes to the door, and chances to hear them. She
therefore advances forward to look for the captain, and upon seeing
him, enters into discourse with him. Parmeno still at some distance
overhears all, and, thinking it was time now for him to appear, ad-
vances as if but just then come out. He afterwards orders the two
slaves to be called out, and presents them. This brings on a conver-
sation full of variety, as being managed by persons of different
characters. These the poet pre-serves with wonderful judgment, so
that among so many speakers we neither meet with one who says
any thing out of character, nor is there any confusion in the discourse.

The metre is Trimeter Iambic.
