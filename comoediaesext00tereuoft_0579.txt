42. Stilpho. [Geta, whispering Phormio] In the Trinummus of
Plautus, where a sharper is employed like Phormio, to carry on an im·

“ Bravo, master! you are right’'--Heus tu Ι eave. [Here Geta turns to

menime, to deter Phormio from evasions, and compel him to come
directly to the point. If apart, they are a caution to Phormio to be
upon his guard. Hitherto Phormio had pretty well sustained the old
