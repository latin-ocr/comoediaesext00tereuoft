Aer 1. SCENE 1. 239

'Phe Greeks and Romans, says Madam Dacier, made use of this ex· κ
pression to signify a courtezan ; and I believe they borrowed that term ι
from the people of the East; since we find it used in that sense in the
books of the Old Testament. Donatus seems to think the word used
here merely as a contemptuous expression. -—- 120. Instat factum.
Supply esse .· ‘⁴ Insists that it was so3 that it was true.'’ Comp. Eun.

The father here foresees what defence his son will make, and owns it to
be such as leaves no room for finding fault. See VS. 24. — 125. Prope
adest. Supply tempus. He alludes to his marriage with the daughter
of Chremes. —- Alieno more. ‘⁴ According to the humour of another.”

amor here. — 129. Εα primum ab illo, διο. “ This disobedience must be

130. ——-- Sa· deneget. ‘⁴ If he refuse to marry Chremes’ daughter.” Simo
here lets Sosia more particularly into his design, and communicates the
project he had formed to come to the knowledge of his son’s senti-
ments, and find a pretence of chiding him. If his attachment to the
stranger prevailed so far as to make him averse to marriage, there was
then sufficient ground to find fault ; but as, Chremes had gone back in
his proposal, there was no opportunity left of forming a judgment. To
remedy this, Simo pretends that the wedding is still going forward‚ and
wants Sosia to second him in this design. If he found Pamphilus
averse, he knew the danger, and must take measures accordingly3 if
otherwise, there was hope that Chremes might still be persuaded to

operam do. Consumere consilia implies the bending of all one’s care to
the accomplishment of a project, and leaving nothing unattempted that
may conduce to it. Colman renders this passage thus ι

“ And that same rascal Davus. if he’s plotting,
That he may let his coumel run to waste,
Now, when his knaveries can do no harm.'’
