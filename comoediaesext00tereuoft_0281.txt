ACT I. SCENE III.

In this scene Davus remains alone upon the stage, and deliberates
with himself what he had best do. On one side, his inclinations lead
him to assist Pamphilus ; on the other, he dreads the threats of his old
master. This naturally leads his thoughts to the engagements between
Pamphilus and Glycerium, and the contrivances they were falling upon
to accomplish their designs. This, says Donatus, is a short and comic
deliberation, calculated to excite the attention of the audience to the
impending events ; artfully relating part of the argument, but in order
to prepare the events without anticipating them, representing the cir-
cumstances of the story as fabulous ; and in order to enliven it, passing
from dry narration to mimickry. How much more artful is the conduct
of Terence in this place, than that of Sir Richard Steele in the
Conscious Lovers, who besides the long narration, with which the play
opem, has obliged the patient, Humphry to hear a second story, with
which he has burthened the conclusion of his first act, from young
Bevil!

This sceneis a mixture of Tetrameter and Trimeter Iambics.

1. Enimvero. This word, says Ruhnken, is expressive of indignation
mingled with sorrow. ‘⁴ Verily, Davus, there's here no room for*
sloth.'' — Segnitiae. This word from segnis, the opposite of alac-ems
means “negligence’' in doing any thing: socordia, from socors, sort
secors, i. e. sine corde, denotes “ sloth ” and ‘⁴ indolence.’' —— 3. Si non
astu. ‘⁶ If they are not cunningly provided against.” Comp. Phorm.
i. 4. 5; Livy, ii. 24. This, says Donatus, is a metaphor from a pilot,
who, having foreseen an approaching storm, provides fdr the safety of 2
his ship. Comp. Cic. Cat. iv. 2.-Me aut herum pessum dabunt.
“ Will either destroy me or Pamphilus.” Pessum dare, as it should ,r
always be written, for submergere, perdere. It is properly said of ξ
things overwhelmed in the ocean. Some take pessum as an adverb g
derived from pes, and signifying “under the feet :'' others think it a ’
» substantive, denoting “the bottom.” It is rather a supine from the ’
antique verb petior, “ I am put under foot.'' See Cortius on Sallust,
Jug. c. 1. - 4. Nec quid agam certum ’st. “ N either have I resolved what
to ἂο.” Certum est for decretum, constitutum est. Supply mihi from

Ejus υἱέα timeo. ‘⁴ I sear for his safety.’' Vita in Terence is often x,
used for salus. Comp. i. 5. 37 ; Adelph. iii. 2. 42. Metuo and timeo, =
in order to avoid ambiguity, are construed with a dative and an ¹
accusative. The evil to be dreaded is always put in the latter case;
and the person for whose safety we are concerned‚ in the former. -—-
6. Verba dare. For fallere, decipere, “to deceive :’' because the

. person who expects the performance of a promise, and ultimately

⁴,obtains nothing but words, is deceived. Comp. iii. 2. 24; Eun. Prol.
