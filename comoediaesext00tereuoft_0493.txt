Lup. i. 17. Madame Dacier imagines Terence refers here to a line in
Hesiod, which says, it is the business of old men to pray. It is more
probable that our author had an eye to the following fine lines of

Menander:
Εἵτις δὲ θυσίαν προσφέρων, ὦ Πάμφιλε,
Ταύρων τε πλῆθος. ἢ ἐρίφων, ἢ, νὴ Δία,
Ἑτέρων τοιούτων, ἢ κατασκευάσματα
Χρυσᾱς ποιήσας· χλαμύδος, ἢτοι πορφυρᾶς,
’Ἢ δι’ ἐλέφαντος, ἢ σμαράγδου ζαίὸια,
Εὔνουν νομίζει τὸν Θεὸν καθιστάναι,
Πλάνατ’ ἐκεῖνος, καὶ φρένας κούφας ἔχει.
Δεῖ ’γὰρ τὸν ἄνδρα χρήσιμον πεφυκέναι,
Μὴ παρθένους φθείροντα, μὴ μοιχιόμενον,
Κλέπτοντα καὶ σφάττοντα χρημάτων χάριν.
Made· βελόνης ἔναμμ’ ἐπιθυμῇς, Πάμφιλε,
'O γάρ θεὸς βλέπει σε πλησίον παρών.

They are thus translated by Colman:

The man who sacrifices, Pamphilus,

A multitude of huns, or goats, or sheep;

Or prepares golden vestments, purple raiment,
Figures of ivory, or precious gems 3

Thinking to render God propitious to him,
Most grossly errs, and bears an empty mind.
Let him be good and charitable rather,

No doer of uncleanness, no corrupter

Of virgin innocence, no murderer, robber‚

In quest of gain. covet not, Pamphilus,

Even a'needle-full of thread ; for God,

Who's always near thee, always sees thy deeds.”

Coveting a needle-full of thread seems to have been a proverbial
expression, as it occurs in other fragments of Menander.

it is plain from this soliloquy, that Terence takes the part of mild
fathers 3 meaning to show that gentle reproofs, mingled with tenderness‚
will have more effect on an ingenuous mind than railing and severity.
That critic also is more minute than usual in pointing out the great
beauties of the entire scene ; commenting on almost every speech, and
observing how finely the two characters of Micio and AEschinus are
sustained throughout the whole conversation. It is impossible not to
discet-n the many amiable touches of good humour, mildness, and
affection that distinguish Micio's character, as well as the natural
strokes of passion and ingenuous shame in AEschinus. The whole
scene is remarkably beautiful, and perhaps more characteristic of the
genius of Terence than any other in his works. — 78. Sed cesso.
