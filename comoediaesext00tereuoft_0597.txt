a quo. Comp. Cic. Orat. i. 37. -- 3. Hera. Phanium. —Ne ob meum.
These three words are scanned here as a dactyl. — Sua-sum. For sua-
sionem, “persuasion.” This word does not occur elsewhere in the
Latin classics. It is found once in Ulpian, Dig. ix. 2. 9. —4. Ita l
patrem, διο. “For Ι hear the father of this young man takes this
match so indignantly.'’ Violenter, δεινῶς. Comp. Eun. v. 4. 32. —5.

8. Nisi me animus-fallit. Comp. Heaut. iv. 1. l. —9. Meae nutricem
gnatae video. Rousseau observes, that among the ancients, nurses,
after having brought up children of their own sex, never quitted them3
which is the reason that in Greek and Latin plays nurses are most
generally chosen for confidantes. Comp. Eun. ii. 2. 58. —Neque ille
investigatur. “ Nor has he been discovered—” Comp. Eun. ii. 3. 3 3 <l
Heaut. iv. 2. 8. This sentence, which had been interrupted by Chremes,
(What shall I do 2) is continued in the next verse, Qui ejus pater est.
Meae in this verse is a monosyllable. — 10. Qui. Perlet is in error,
when he says qui here is put for quis. Qui is a relative, and refers to
ille in the preceding verse. — Dum cognosco. For dum with an indica-
tive, see Andr. ii. 1. 293 Eun. i. 2. 126. -- 11. Quod si eum, διο. “ Sup-

ii. 3. 12.—Saevam. For iratam. Comp. Andr. v. 2. 27.—-18. Eo.
For ob id, or hanc ob causam. Comp. Eun. i. 2. 17. ——Foris. For
palam. Comp. Heaut. v. 1. 50. ·— 19. Atque id porro, διο. “And lest
my wife should, moreover, by some means, come to the knowledge of
that name.'' ——20. Istoc pol, διο. “ And from this cause it was that
we, poor souls, could never find you out here.’'

21. Cum familia hac. [Chremes pointing to the house os Demipho]
Comp. Andr. ii. 1. 22. —23. Ex oegrc‘tudine. ‘⁴ Through grief.’' The
poet, says Donatus, has here observed a just mean, in neither making
