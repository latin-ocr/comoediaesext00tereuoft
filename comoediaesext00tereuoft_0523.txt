Aer 11. γεοΕΝΕ 1. 485

Jerome‘on Michaam‚ (c. 7, ) and all the commentators on Terence,
afver him, have remarked the ambiguity of this verse. Bentley, who
condemns the line as spurious, puts this question. Sa· omnium est idem
studium, maisit, at nurus et socrus tantopere inter se discrepent? By the
insertion of a single word, the measure of the verse becomes perfect,
and all obJections are obviated. I would read—-

Itaque adeo uno animo omnes socrus invicem oderunt nurus ; -
that is, as St. Jerome says, nurus socrum, et socrus odit nurum. As

the verse stands at present, in order to scan it as a Tetrameter Iambic
Acatalectic, we must suppose a defect of the synalaepha in two places ς

the first between adeo and uno, and the second between animo and γ

omnes,- thus:
Itaq’ ἄιίἔό l i'cn' dmm& Ι &mnis εόονῐιε &derant ηανῖὶε.

But the ἀμφιβολία still remains. -- Uno animo. For eodem animo.
Comp. Andr. i. 1. 693 Ovid, Met. Χ. 33. —That mothers: ln- law hate
their daughters· m· -laW‚ is a general persuasion, prevalent not only' m
the time of our poet, but still equally reeeived3 and it is certain, that
the frequent animosities between them have‘ given too great a founda-

tion for such a notion. But it is a fault to be governed by general
prejudices. Many iustances of perfect harmony and a good under-
standing between the above-mentioned kind of relations occur every
day3 and these ought to have equal influence, and make us judge
in doubtful cases favourably. Laches here reviles his wife upon a false

averse to their daughters-in-law. Terence here exposes the foll'y of
giving too easily into such prejudices. Here we have a mother-in-law,
who, far from hating her daughter-in law, loves her tenderly; and the
old man exposes himself to ridicule by his obstinacy, and unreasonable
abuse of a woman who so little deserved it.
