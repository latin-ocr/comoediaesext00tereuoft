lived, is partly to be defended, partly to be praised ; and although it is
necessary to confess that she is a courtezan, yet her behaviour is ren-
dered as excusable as such a circumstance will admit. ——Parce‚ ac
duriter, διο. “ Thristy, though poor, she lived ς with her own hands a
hemely livelihood scarce earning from the distaff and the loom.”
Comp. VirgiL AEn. viii. 409. Duriter, ‘⁴ laboriously,’' ‘⁴ industriously.”

ac tela. Spinning and weaving were the chief employments of the
matrons of antiquity, and even of the most noble. See casaubon on
Sueton. Aug. c. 64. —- Quceritans. The verb quaeritare properly signifies ,s
“to acquire with difficulty.'’—49. Amans. Donatus makes this dis-
tinction between amator and amans.- the love of the former may be
feigned, but the love of the latter is real. —Pretium Ὑμεῖς μὲν ὀρέγεσθε
κάλλους· ἐγώ δε χρημάτων ε’ρῶ, Aristaen. Epist. i. 14. Comp. Adelph.
iii. 2. 51. Pretium is put for aarum in Horace, Od. iii. 16, 8. —50.
Unus et item alter. “ One or two lovers.” Donatus thinks this means
“two or three lovers,’' referring to vs. 60, but he is clearly refuted by
Ruhnken. Comp. Ovid, Epist. xv. 182. Unus et alter is used also for
an indefinite number, as in Cic: Att. xiv. 18. See Burmann-on Petron.

·- 53. Ita utfit. “ As is generally the case.'' -— 54. Perduxere illuc. J
“ Drew thither.'' Simo, according to Donatus, uses the verb perduxere

cogitare. Comp. Emi. iv. 2. 8. Ovid. Met. x. 586. — 55. Captus est ,-
habet. Expressions horrowed from the eombats of the gladiators in„
the circus. When the retiarius, with a trident called fiis-cina in his left
hand, and a net in his right, matched against his adversary the mir· ’ῃ
millo, succeeded in entangling him in his net, the speetators used to
exclaim captus est. Again, when any gladiator received a remarkable ’ζ
wound, the exclamation was habet, or hoc habet. See the commen- ¹
tators on Juvenal, viii. 200. - 57. Rogitabam. Not rogabam, which
signifies merely “to ask,” but rogitabam, “to ask often, and with
eagerness.” - 58. Dic sodes. “ Tell me, I entreat you.'’ Sodes is
composed of si audes. —Habuia Ἐρωμένην εἶχεν, Achil. Tat. vii. 9. -
