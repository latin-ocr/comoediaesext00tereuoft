262 ANDRIA.

-— Quid opus facto esset. For quid faciendum esset. Comp. iv. 2. 323 j
Heaut. i. 1. 28; Hec. iii. 1. 47; Phorm v. 1. 35. -—- 11. Clamat de* via. ¹
“From the street she bawls out to those within.'’— Illis. To the ¹3
female servants. - 12. Itane tandem, &c. “ Do Ι really seem so fita
person to be played upon? '' Itane tandem is an elegant formula of ’
great force in interrogations. Comp. Heaut. v. 2. 13 Phorm. ii. 3. 263
Livy, iii. 9. For tandem also see Hec. iv. 4. 613 Cic. Cat. i. 1.——13.
Fallere incipias. For fallas. So deligere inciperes, Catull. lxxxi. 2.
Comp. v. 1. 2. —— 14. Saltem accurate. ‘⁴ You should at least have done
it more artfully.’' — Ut metui videar certe. “ That I might at least '
seem to be feared.” Or, as Colman has it : “ Were it only to pretend
you feared my anger, should I find you out.’'

15. Certe hercle. [Davus asida] “ In saith, now he deceives himself,
not I.'' Certe. This he repeats after his master. Comp. ii. 6. 24.
——Se ipsus. The pronoun ipse is often joined to another pronoun,
sometimes in the same case, oftener not. Graevius, on Cic. Off. iii. 15,
condemns those who put both pronouns in the same case. Manutius,
on Cic. ad Div. vii. l. thinks either mode correct. See Duker on Flor.
iii. 18. —Edtxz‘n’ tibi. “Did I not give you warning?¹’ Masters
are said edicere, “to give imperative commands” to their servants.
Comp. Hec. iv. 1. 50. — 16. Interminatus sum, Sto. “Did I not
threaten you, lest you should play those tricks?'' — Quid retulit?
. “ What did your imposition profit you ?’' Comp. Phorm. iv. 3. 41. —
17. Credon‘ tibi hoc remae, Sto. ‘⁴ What ! think you I believe in this ‘2⁹’
-— 18. Quid agam habeo. [Davus aside.] “ I know now how to act:
I know my game.'’ A person is said habere, when he has hit on any
expedient. Comp. Eun. iii. 2. 22; and see Burmann on Phaedr. iv. 12.
-- 19. Quasi reon tibi, διο. [Davus ambly] “As if you had not been
informed of this?”—20. Eho an tute. [Davus arc-My] “Oh! so
you found it out yourself? ”

21. Remmciatum’st. “ You must have been informed3 or whence
this shrewd suspicion ‘2⁵’ — 22. Qui ? quia te noram? ‘⁴ How ’.Ρ because
I knew you.” Qui for unde. '— Quasi tu dicas. “ As much as to say,
it was done by my advice.'’ -23. Certe enim scio. Σαφῶς ’γὰρ οἶδα.
The particle enim, like the Greek γὰρ is redundant, as in the Adebphi,
v. 5. 22. Comp. Virg. Georg. iii. 70. Or, it may be explained by
supplying an ellipsis thus : “ Don’t wonder, for I certainly do know it.”
*- Non satis me, δίο. “ You do not thoroughly know me yet.’‘ Etiam
here for adhuc. Comp. i. 1. 893 Virg. AEn. vi. 485. -24. Egone te?
< ‘⁴ Ι not know you? '’ -— Dari verba. Comp. i. 3. 6. — 25. Falso.

The common editions have,

continuo dari
Tibi verba censes. Sr. Falso. DA. Itaque hercle, διο.

where falso is understood to be said sneeringly by Simo: “ Falsely, 1
suppose.'’ Others read it interrogatively: “And do I think so without
reason 2⁹² — 27. Sed nihilo secius. “But nevertheless.” -Mox puerum.
Comp. iv. 4. 3, Sec. -28. Id ego jam nunc, διο. “Ι now give you
timely warning that it will be so, that you may be prepared.’' Davus
here makes use of Simo’s error to forward his own designs; and warns
him of what he was himself to do, that the old man might not suspect
his being eoncerned in a project, which he had seemingly betrayed to
him. The art of this passage is equal to its pleasantry3 for though
this is said by Davus merely to dupe the old man, yet it very naturally
