’ ὃοειΑ. For Sosius ,· so Byrrhia, Chaerea‚ Clinia, Geta, for Byr-ricius,
Chaereas, (Ιῖὲηἱαε, Getas. Terence, conformably to the custom of the
ancients, omits the final S in these and similar names. Sosia is de·

rived from σώζειν, “ to save ;’'—preserved in war. .
DAvus. A slave belonging to Simo, the confidant of Pamphilus——

a shrewd‚ cunning knave, and full of hope and daring. He is so
called from his country, as many slaves were. The Daci were an-
ciently called Davi, Δᾶοι. See Strabo, vii. 12, and Horace, Sat. ii·

5· giras. A female servant of Glycerium, much attached to her

mistress; named from Mysia, her country.
Pmrmnus. The son of Simo, and lover of Glycerium3 πᾶσι

φίλος, “ dear to all.”
CHARINUS. A young man, an acquaintance of Pamphilus, in love

with Philumena. His name is derived from χάρις, “ grace,'’ ‘⁶ bene--

volenee.”
BYRRHIA. See Sosia above. ¹A timid slave, and, in character

quite the reverse of Davus. Some derive his name from πυρῤὸς.,
“ red.'’ Hadrian Junius, de Coma, thinks his name should be written
Pyrrh-ia. Others suppose it to be a Gentile name from Pyrrha, a city

Offfggizzih. So called from the island of Lesbos, famous for wine.

See the commentators on Horace, Od. i. 17. 21.

GLYCERIUM. A daughter of Chremes, and sister of Philumenam
from γλυκερὸς, the same as γλυκὺς, “ sweet.”

CHREMES. The father of Glycerium and Philumena; a peaceable,
good-natured old man. His name is derived from χρέμπτεσθαι, ertia-e
exspuere. Old men are often troubled with an inveterate cough.
Perlet is in error when he tells us that this is the avaricious old man
named by Horace, Epod. i. 33. The Chremes mentioned by Horace
was a character in the Thesaurus of Menander. See Note on Eun.

Prgliulssi A native of Andros, and a near relative of Chrysis3 from

κριτὴς, “ a judge,’' or* “ umpire.” The difference between Pamphilus

and his father was settled by his means.

duty was to confine and lash the other slaves, at his master's pleasure.

Δ Cnnvsm. An Andrian courtezan‚ the protectress of Glycerium:
from xpm-«35, “ gold.'’

PROLOGUE.

Tite design of this Prologue is to dispose the people in favour of
the new poet, and to raise their contempt against the old. The author
complains that he was forced to deviate from the common method of
prologues, and to consume his time in defending himself against

unjust calumnies and reproaches
The metre is Trimeter Iambic‚ which the Latins call Senarian.

l. Animum ad scribendum appulit. ‘⁴ Directed his thoughts to
writing comedy.'' So-ad uxorem animum appellere, ii. 6. 15, “ to have.
