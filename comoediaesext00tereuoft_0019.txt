LIFE OF TERENCE. V

' remainder of his play, of which Caecilius expressed the greatest admi-
ration. This comedy was adapted to the Roman stage when Terence
was in his twenty-eighth year3 and was translated, or at least borrowed,
from the Greek of Menander. ’ The Eunuchus had such remarkable
succeSS, that it was called for twice in the same day, being performed
both in the morning and in the evening: and he received a larger sum
for it than had ever been paid for any previous drama‚—-eight thousand
sesterces, equivalent to 5364. lls. Sd. of our money. Of this, it is said,
he took care to inform the public in the Inscription* to that play.

Terence, in common with other conspicuous characters, became ob-
noxious to detraction. It was rumoured, that his intimate friends,
Scipio and Laelius, by their taste and criticism, -not only materially
assisted in polishing the language of his plays‚† and otherwise bringing
them to their present perfectiori, but even contributed whole scenes :—
nay, more, that the former composed these comedies, and permitted
Terence to gather the bays and reap the profits. The following story
Cornelius Nepos asserts was prevalent in his time 2—Lae1ius being at
his villa near Puteoli, (now Pozzuoli,) near Naples, on the first of
March, the feast of the Matronalia‚ was directed by his wife to come to
supper at an earlier hour than usual, for on that day the Roman ladies
. claimed the sole and uncontrolled sway over their households; but he
begged her not to disturb him. Upon his joining the family rather late,
he declared that he had never succeeded in his compositions so happily
as that evening3 and being requested to inform them what passage had
so much pleased him, he repeated those verses beginning with

Satis pol proterve me Syri promissa huc induxerunt,

which are to be found now in the Heauton Timorumenos, (iv, 4. 1.)
However this might be‚—and Terence himself, in the Prologue to the
Adelphi, but slightly refutes this opinion, though in that of the Heauton
Timorumenos he flatly contradicts it,—we‚ who at this distance of time
can judge dispassionately of them, must confess, that from the intrinsic
evidence of the style and manner, they are undoubtedly the work of
one person 3 and can have ,no hesitation in believing them to be solely
the productiori of him under whose name, as their author, they have

come down to us. It does not detract from the merit of Terence to ,

acknowledge that he adopted the elegant and judicious corrections of
his friends: on the contrary, it proves that he had the good sense to
see, appreciate, and insert, such suggestions of others as would tend to
beautify and perfectionate his compositions.

Perhaps he was not altogether unwilling that it should be broadly
hinted, that his pati-ons, Scipio and Laelius, had contributed to his
dramatic wrifings, being aware that such flattering notice would 'be far
from displeasing to them. Santra,‡ an author of Julius Caesar’s time,

⁸ The Inscription of the Andria, as it now stands, contains nothing to this
purport: a proof that it has come down to us in an imperfect state.

ἢ Some suppose that, as Terence was an African, he necessarily required
assistance in polishing his language. On this Madame Dacier observes: This

“ reasoning is by no means conclusive. Phaedrus was a Thracian slave, yet no one

wrote more correetly, or with greater purity3 nor was he ever taxed with having
received any assistance in his compositions. Why then suspect Terence, when
Suetonius, in the very beginning of his life, confesses that he had been very care-
fully educated and made free in his early youth by Terentius Lucanus?

1 Santra composed a treatise on the Antiquity¹os Words, and another on the
Livet of [nustricus Men. But his works are all lost.
