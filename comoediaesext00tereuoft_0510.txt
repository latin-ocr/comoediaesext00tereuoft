11. Alii meliores erurit. “Other slaves will become better ; ” i. e.
it will be an encouragement to other slaves, to imitate the conduct of
Syrus, and endeavour to profit thereby. The grave irony of this
passage, says Donatus, is extremely humorous. —— 12. Hic. AEsehi-
nus. —- Vin’ tu. [Micio turns to AEschinus:] “And do you desire
this 2 '’ — 13. Liber esto. [Here Micio turns Syrus round in a circle, gives
him α blow on the cheek, and dismisses him] The usual formula was
Hunc hominem liberum esse volo. — Bene facis. Comp. y. 8. 223 Eun.

extravagance Ξ ” This passage is borrowed from the comic poet
Caecilius. — Quae istaee subita est largitas ‚⁹ ‘⁴ Whence this sudden
prodigality?'' Comp. Phaedr. i. 23. 7. Micio is astonished at so
many acts of profusiori in Demea, and therefore regards them not as
instances of good-nature, but as proceeding from a sudden contracted
bias to liberality.—29. Quod. For propter quod. Comp. Eun. iii.

Comp. Eun. ii. 2. 22.- Indulgendo. Comp. Heaut. iv. 8. 20.-32.
Nunc adeo. This passage is well translated by Colman:

“ Now, therefore, if I'm odious to you, son,
Because I’m not subservient to your humour, “
In all things, right, or wrong ; away with care l
Spend, squander, and do what you will s—But if,
111 those affairs where youth has made you blind,
Eager, and thoughtless‚ you will suffer me
To counsel and correct you—and in due season
Indulge you-I am at your service.”

Here Demea returns to his proper⁴ character, and unriddles to his
brother the mystery of his sudden change of manners3 that he onlys
meant to satissy him, that his' blind complaisance and indulgence for
his children was the sole cause of the affection they had for him; and
that it was an easy matter to gain it, where one could reconcile himself
to the means. The opposite characters of these two brothers, and the
inconveniences they bring upon themselves, clearly point out to
parents the middle course they ought to hold in the training up of
their children, between excessive rigour on the one side, and an over-
strained indulgence on the other.
