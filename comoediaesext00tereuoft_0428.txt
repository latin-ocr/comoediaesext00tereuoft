Syrus is alarmed, fearing that, by the discovery of Antiphila, their
plot on Menedemus would be baffled, and their imposition on chremes
detected.

one—Olim nil minus. For Ι was poor then. Here ends the act
in some editions, and by the discovery of Antiphila, to all appearance,
the main story of the piece. The following observation on the great
art of our poet, in continuing it through two acts more, is extremely
just and ingenious. What would become of the piece, says Didero‘a
which Terence has called the Heauton Timorumenos, if the poet had
not, by an extraordinary effort of genius, contrived to take up the
story of Clinia anew, and to weave it in with the intrigue of Cliti-pho?

 

ACT IV. Scmm II.

In the former scene Syrus was present at the discovery that
Antiphila was the daughter of Chremes. He also appears to be not
a little concerned at it, apprehending that it may be of ill conse
quence to himself. The rest having gone into the house to inquire
further of the ring, heis lest alone upon the stage, full of this notiori,
and contriving with himself how he may best avoid the threatening'
danger.

This scene consists of Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic.

1. Nisi me animus fallit. Comp. iv. l. 1; Hec. v. 1. 2. Madame
Dacier, and most of the later critics‚ who have implicitly followed her,
tell us, that, in the interval between the former scene and this, Syrus
has been present at the interview between Chremes and Antiphila
within. The only difficulty m this doctrine is how to reconcile it to
the apparent ignorance of Syrus, which he discovers at the entrance of
Clinia. But this objection, she says, is easily answered. Syrus,
having partly heard Antiphila's story, and finding things likely to
take an unfavourable turn, retires to consider what is best to be done.
But surely this is a most unnatural impatience at so critical a junctum :g
and aster all, would it not be better to take up the matter just where
Terence has left it,'and to suppose that Syrus knew nothing more of the
affair than what might be collected from the late conversation between
Chremes and Sostrata, at which we know he was present? This at
once accounts for his apprehensionS, which he betrayed even during

that scene, as well as for his imperfect knowledge of the real state of ,

the case, till apprised of the whole by Clinia ——2. Oppido. An
