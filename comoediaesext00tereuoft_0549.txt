Phidippus utters these words with an air of disinclination to be present
at this conference; and the characters are well sustained in this instance:
for it would not become him to discourse coolly with a courtezan, whom
he supposed to be the seducer of Pamphilus from his daughter, althou h
he might very properly advise such a conversation, as conducive to t e

peace of both families. — 104. Immo vero, διο. “ No ε go seek a nurse

ACT V. Serme Ι.

The two old men in the last scene had agreed to send for Bacchis,
whom they suspected to be the cause of Pamphilus’s refusing so obsti-
nately to take back his wife. Phidippus, meantime, goes to look for a
nurse, and Laches is left to discourse with Bacchis, who here comes
upon the stage wondering what the old man can want with' her. She,
indeed, suspected the matter3 and, conscious that she had given no
encouragement to Pamphilus, was resolved to vindicate him, and, if
possible, to remove every suspicion he might lie under on her account.
. Accordingly she enters upon the task with great warmth and friend-
ship, and succeeds so far as to gain credit with Laches, who further
requests her to go in to the women themselves, and use her endeavours
to remove all their jealousies.
