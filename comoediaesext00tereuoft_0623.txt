and even ‘ the common· run of laughers in our theatre‚’ allow and
applaud in our gayest comedies. Ι cannot, however, think that he ever
trespasses on the severity or solemnity of tragedy: nor can I think
that there are not touches of humour in every one of his plays which he
has left behind him ; some humour of dialogue‚ more of character, and
still more of comic situation, necessarily resulting from the artful con-
texture of his pieces. The Andria, Eunuchus, Adelphi, and Phormio,
especially the second and fourth, are confessedly pleasant comedies;
and the Eunuchus, in particular, the most favourite entertainment of
the Roman theatre. Instances of humour have been produced by the
ingenious critic himself, even from the Heauton Tz’morumenos. As to
the present comedy (the Heauton Timorumenos), I should imagine that
a man, with much less mercury in his composition than Sir Richard
Steele, might have met with more than one or two passages in it, that
would raise a laugh. Terence indeed does not, like the player-clowns
mentioned by Shakespeare‘s Hamlet, ‘ set on the spectators to laugh,
though in the mean time some necessary question of the play be to be
considered-¹ He never starts from the subject merely to indulge him-
sels in pleasantries, like Plautus, and even Moliere, for whole scenes
together. His humour always arises from the occasion, and flows from
him in the natural course of the fable ς in which he not only does not
admit idle scenes, but scarcely a speech that is not immediately condu-
eive to the business of the drama. His humour, therefore, must neces-
sarily lie close and compact, and requires the constant attention of the
reader to the incidents that produce it; on which dramatic humour
osten in great measure depends, and would, therefore, of course unfold
itself in the representation, when those incidents were thrown into
action. In the present comedy, the character of Syrus, bating the
description in the second act, must be allowed to be wholly comic3 and¹
that of Chremes still more so. The conduct of the third and fourth
acts is happily contrived for the production of mirth3 and the situation
of the two old men in the first scene of the fifth act is very pleasantly
imagined. The deep distress of Menedemus, with which the play opens,
makes but a very inconsiderable part of Terence's comedy; and I am
apt to think, as I have before hinted in another place, that the Heauton
Timorumenos of Menander was a more capital and interesting character.
As our poet has contrived, the sels-punishment of Menedemus ends as
soon as the play begins. The son returns in the very second scene;
and the chief cause of the grief of Menedemus being removed, other
incidents, and those of the most comic cast too, are worked into the
play3 which, in relation to the subject of it, might perhaps, with more
propriety, have been entitled ‘ The· Fathersss I cannot, therefore,
notwithstanding ‘the pathos and simplicity of the first scene, agree,
‘ that this comedy has the gravity of tragedy itselfi’ ''—COLMAN.

“ I would have characters separated from each other ς but I must own
that a direct contrast displeases me.

‘⁶ But the most sure method to spoil a play, and to render it quite
insupportable‚ would be to multiply such contrasts.
