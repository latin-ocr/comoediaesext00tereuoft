234 ANDRIA.

Sosia is a dealer in old sayings. The very next time he opens his mouth} j
he utters another. , ·’“
35. Facile omnes perferre, διο. “ With ease and good humour he ε·
3 bore with and overlooked the foibles of all.'' Perferre and pati for
³ perferebat and patiebatur. Compare Eun. iii. 3. 9. This is very com& ’ῗ
mon in Sallust. The verbs perferre and pati are frequently joined ,
together. Comp. Caes. B. G. vii. 30. -- 36. Cum quibus erat cumque.¹
Here the quibas and cumque are elegantly separated by tmesis. This „
·is of frequent occurrence. Comp. i. 5. 28.-—Iz·s sese dedere. “He ·
complied with their will, and suited himself to their temper.'’ A η
metaphor from a vanquished army surrendering to its conqueror. ’
Comp. Eun. v. 7. 2. ; Heaut. iv. 3. 3. ; See Bentley on Hor. od. iii. 5. 33.
—38. Ita. “ By so doing.‘' — 39. Invenias. The second person for the
⁸ third, inveniat, “ one may obtain.’' So cernas for cernat, Virg. AEw.
iv. 401. The verb invenire is used in the sense of ‘⁴ obtaining‚” as in
Heaut. iv. 7. 13. So εὑρίσκειν is sometimes used in Greek. —41. Obse-
quium amicos, διο. “ Complaisance raises friends, plain truth breeds ’,ι
hatred.’' Madam Dacier very justly remarks here, that when Simo ¹
speaks of his son's complaisance, he means an honest complaisance, ’
remote from flattery‚ and that did not interfere with truth. To suppose
the contrary, would be to make him blame instead of commending his ·'
son. But as servants are not always capable of entering into these -
nice differences‚ Sosia takes occasion from thence to inveigh against
· the age, by saying that it was offended with truth. Thus he takes
obsequium, which properly signifies ‘⁴ sweetness of- manners,” for· a
mean servile flattery; the most hateful and contemptible of» all-vicesa -,
There is an inimitable justness in all Terence's characters.
42. Mulier quaedam. He says this in contempt, as appears from the
word qzccedam. Comp. Adelph. iv. 5. 13.--Abkz·nc triennium. The
mention of this distance of time is certainly artful, as it affords time

for all the events, previous to the opening of the piece, to have hap-
pened with the strictest probability. The comment of Donatus on this
passage is curious ι The author has artfully said three years, when he Ἀ
might have given a longer or a shorter perlod: since it is probable
that a woman might have lived modestly one year, turned courtezau
the next, and died the third. In the first year, therefore, Pamphilus
knew nothing of the family of Chrysis, in the second he became
acquainted with Glycerium, and in the third, Glycerium marries
Pamphilus and finds her parents. —43. Huc viciniae. “To this city
and our immediate neighbourhood.” Donatus supposes a pleonasm
in the addition of the word vieiniae. Almost all the old editions have huic
vic-inice, which Ruhnken seems to approve. Comp. Phorm. i. 2. 45. ·-.
44. Cognatorum negligentia. The Athenian laws provided, that the next
of kin should either marry an indigent female relation, or endow her
with a suitable portion. Comp. Adelph. iv. 5. 18. - 45. Egregia forma,
&c. “ In the bloom of youth and beauty.” Comp. Eun. iii. 2. 20.--46.
Hei, vereor, &c. “ Alas Ξ Ι sear this Andrian forbodes some mischiet'.”
The particle ne after vereor is taken in a positive sense; ut after the
same verb in a negative signification. — Andria. Chrysis. -- 47.
Primum haec pudice. It is absolutely necessary, says Donatus, that
the reputation of Glycerium should be supposed to be spotless and
unblemished: and as she could never be made an honest woman, if it
were not clear that she was so before marriage, Chrysis, with whom she
