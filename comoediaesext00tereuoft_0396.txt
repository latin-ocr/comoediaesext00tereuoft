Ne ille pro se, διο. “ Ι say faultless, lest he should think I speak for
him, who lately introduced a running slave, making the crowd give
way.” It must have been a wretched piece, says Madame Dacier, if '
this was the most beautiful passage in it. Yet such an incident is

often necessary, as may be seen in the Amphitryo of Plautus, where
Mercury runs in crying,

Concedite atque abscedite, omnes de via decedite.

Terence, therefore, only blames those authors, who, like Lucius-
Lavinius, made it the capital circumstance in their plays. On this,
Colman observes, Had Madame Dacier quoted the whole passage in

the Amphitryo, Ι think it would have been evident that Plautus also
meant to ridicule the like practice :

⁴⁴ Give place, make room, stand by, and clear the way,
Nor any be so bold to stop my speed!
For shall not Ι, who am a deity,
Menace the crowd, unless they yield to me,
As well as slaves in comedy 't ''

defence of a fool ?’' Bentley reads:

Qui nuper fecit servo currenti in via
Populum dixisse, Cur insano serviat ?

“ Who lately introduced the people on the stage, addressing a Emath-
less slave, and asking him, why he served an insane master ‘t” Reiu-
hardt edited from conjecture:

ne ille pro se dictum existumet.
Qui nuper fecit, servo currenti in via
Decesse populum, cur in sanos soeviat?

Why should he rail against persons of sound understanding‚ who him-
self is so ridiculous as to introduce,'’ διο. -- 34. Nisi finem. Comp.

pleaded the cause of the poet: the remainder of the prologue is spoken
in behalf of himself. -36. Statariam. “The comedy of the Romans
was either Stataria, Motoria, or Mixta. The Stataria means a comedy
which is calm and peaceable, such as the Cistellaria of Plautus; Moto—
ria‚ one full of action and commotion, like his Amphitryo. The comoedia
mia-ta was &mixture of both, such as the Eunuchus of Terence. Some
Commentators, says Madame Dacier, imagine that Terence means one
character only by ¹rtatariam, as if personam were to be understood, but
though the ancients did call the actors statarios and motor-ios, according
to the different parts they were engaged in, I am convinced that it rs
not in this place at all applicable to them, but to the whole comedy,
how else are we to explain the 45th verse ? To apply it to any one of
the other actors of the company, would be overstraining the sense of
the text. Being entirely of a different opinion from Madame Dacier,
concerning the sense of the words statarium agere, I have translated
them, ‘ to act an easy part} as referring merely to the character which
