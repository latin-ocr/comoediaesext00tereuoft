33. Per aetatem. “ In consequence of her tender age.’' Comp.
Adelph. v. 8. 8. -α 35. Unde emerat. “ From whom he purchased her.'’
So genus unde Latinum, Virg. AEn. i. 6.—-E Sunio. Sunium was a
part of Attica upon the sea-coast3 hence vs. 30. Ex Attica hinc
abreptam. Thais here proceeds with her relation, in which she takes
care to omit no circumstance,by which she might give a more coloura-
ble pretence for her earnestness to be in possession of the young girl.
She had been bred up with her from a child3 she had been always
accounted her sister; there was a probability that she was a citizen of
Athens; and, if she could restore her to her relations, she might thereby
secure to herself some powerful friends in a place* where she was a
stranger, and might be easily oppressed without some such support.
It is probable that Thais foresaw Phaedria's suspicions, and, therefore,
is at all these pains, and sums up her reasons at the end of her speech
to prevent them. — 37. Docere.. Put here for aliis docendam tradere,
as in Hor. Sat. i. 6. 77. So erudire in Nepos, Att. c. l·. —Ita uti si
esset. The more usual expression is ac si esset.. Comp. Phorm. ii. 3.
623 Cic. Off. i. 143 Nepos, Datam. c. 3.

39. Quicum tum uno rem habebam. ‘⁶ With whom alone I was then
connected? Comp. Hes. iv. 4. 96.—40. Reliquit. Supply testa-
mento. Comp. Hec. iii. 5. 8. —4-1. Qui istuc? “Why so ἶν’ -42.
Neque solus. “And no single person.'’——43. Nam bic quoque, &c.
“For my master also made good and large addition.’' Bonam and
magnam her-e are synonymous. Comp. Hor. Sat. i. 1. 61 3 val. Max.
ii. 9. 7.-—45. Miles. Thraso. -4.6. Interea loci. “ In the mean
time.” Comp. ii. 2. 24. — 47. Postilla. For postea.—Intamum. Comp.
Andr. iii. 3. 44. It is artful in the poet to make the soldier the prior
lover, by which Thais is at liberty to plead for this indulgence with a
better grace. For she says she knew not Phaedria tiu afterwards,
during the soldier's absence. — 48. Mea consilia ut tibi credam omnia.

. This Phraedia did not believe, and gives her a pretty good hint of his

disbelief in the following verse, Neque hoc tacebit Parmeno. —49. Oh,
dubiumne id est ‚⁹ Parmeno assents to what his master had said. “ Ο,
is there any doubt of that?”

50. Hoc agite, amabo. ‘⁴ Attend, I beseech you.” Comp. Andr. i.
2. 15; ii. 5. 4 ; Adelph. ii. 2. 18 ; Phorm. ii. 3. 3. - 51. Ad rem.
“ To save and increase his wealth.'’ Comp. Adelph. v. 8. 31. - 52.

54. Producit. “Exposes her for sale.” Comp. Heaut. i. 1. 92. Sueton.
Tib. c. 34. —Forte fortuna. “ By good chance.” These words. are
frequently joined, and are thus always taken in a favourable sense.
Comp. Phorm. v. 6. 1 ; Hee. iii. 3. 26.—55. Hic meus amicus. As she
ἴε now speaking of his kindness and.civility to her, she does notuse the
word miles, but amicus, a title that he seemed to merit from her. This
isstssl set in a clearer light from what follows: Emit eam dono mihi, διο.
By this is insinuated with how much greater earnestness and pleasure
he would have done it, had· he known all: It carries moreover the
fiattering idea of her imparting her secrets to Phaedria,and. acquainting
him with things that his rival was a stranger to.—56. Imprudens.
See. note on Andr. i. 3. 22.-58. Rem habere. Comp. vs. 39.-—Fingit
causas. “He feigns excuses.” Comp. Andr. i. 3. 15. Perlet cites
