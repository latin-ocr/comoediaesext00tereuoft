452 ADELPm.

xxxvi. 8. — Perii! [This AEschinus says aside, and is overheard 1131
Micio, who, however, dissembles. ]

19. Nil. recte: perge. “Nothing. —We11. ‚pray go on.’ — 20.
Mileti. “At Miletus‚'’ a colony of the Atheniens in Pontus. — 21.
Miletum usqae. The adverb usque is often put after the name of a
place, which in the proper order of construction should follow it.
Comp. Cic. Att. vi. 2. —— Animo male ’st. [Aside] Supply mihi. “ It
wounds me to the very soul.'’ Comp. Catull. xxxviii. 1 ; Ovid, ‘ t.
xii. 144 ; Petron. c. 54. -— 22. Quid illas censes Ρ “ Why, what do you
think they should say ’.Ψ Comp. Andr. v. 2. 12. ——Nihil enim. ‘⁴ Just
nothing.'' Comp. Hec. v. 4. 10. — 23. Commenta. Comp. Hec. iii.
l. 53. - 25. Priorem. For potiorem. Comp. Eun. i. 2. 7l.—Non
oportere huic dari. ‘⁴ That she ought not to be given to my friend.'’ ——
26. Eho, nonne haec, &a “ What did not these reasons, after you‘hffllv
heard them, appear sufficient to you?” So Donatus interprets this

passage. The Bipont editors give the verse thus, from the Strasburg
edition of 1496:

Eho, nonne haec justa tibi videntur 7 Postea ......

They suppose that AEschinus was about to add Postea etiam illam hinc
abducet? when he was interrupted by Micio. Donatus, after giving
the former interpretation, says that postea appears to be redundant. -τ
28. Quid illam ni. A comic tmesis for quidni illam. -— 29. Immiseri—
corditer. Although AEschinus here keeps upon the reserve, asnot,
designing at present to acquaint his father with his passion, yet >the-
poet takes care not to lose sight of the lover. AEschinus expresses
himself with so much warmth and eagerness, that had Micio known
nothing before of his passion for Pamphila, he might easily have
guessed how the case stood. The commentators notice the length of
this adverb, as being well adapted to the sorrow of AEschinus‚ as well
as the other adverbs, all ending in ter. Comp. Andr. i. 1. 47. — Atque
etiam si est, pater, διο. “ And, to speak plainly, sir, ungenerous.'’
Farnaby reads si est pater, with this interpretation: Ex quo natus est
filius.

31. Quid illi tandem. Comp. Ean. v. 6. 14. Tandem for igitur.—
32. Qui oum ea consuevit. Comp. Hec. iv. 1. 40: Cic. Verr. v. 12.—
33. Haud scio an. This may be rendered “ perhaps,’' or ‘⁴ no doubt.'’,
See Ernesti Clav. Cic. — Misere amat. Comp. Andr. iii. 2. 40. — 34.
Praesens praesentem. That is, praesens amator prasentem amicam. So in
Virg. AEn. ἰν. 83, absens absentem audit. -— 36. Qua ratione istuc?
Supply dicis. — Quis despondit ‚7 διο. These questions, says Donatus,
which enumerate all the prooss requisite to a marriage, are an indirect
and very delicate reproof to AEschinus, for the irregular and clandestine
manner in which he had conducted the affair. — 37. Cui ? Supply
data est. Comp. Andr. i. 1. 75; ii. 2. 15.- Auctor. The auctores
nuptiarum are the perenm, the relations, or the guardiam, without
whose sanction a female could not legally contract marriage according
to the laws of the Greeks or Romans. — 38. Cur duait alienam?
“Wherefore did he wed another‘s right? ’' —- Sedere domi. ‘⁶ To
remain single.” Comp. Vir . AEn. vii. 52. -— 39. Tam grandem. “ Of
so mature an age.” Θυγ τηρ ἐπίγαμος, Menander. — Hine illine.
“ Nobody knows whence.'’ See Graevius on Flor. iv. 2. Hinc illine
became proverbial. —- 40. Haec te dicere, διο. “ This it was your duty
