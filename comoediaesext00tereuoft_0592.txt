31. Satin’ illz' Di sunt propitii? “ Is he in his senses?” The

— 32. Sc· tu aliquam partem, διο. “ If you speak in any measure

commutare verba is generally taken in an unfavourable sense, being a
phrasethat exactly answers to ours, of “ having words with any one,'’
which implies a quarrel. In the Andria just quoted, where Davus

rebuke, we meet with the very same phrase. -— 37. Insanibat. ‘⁴ Was

Attio talent, if any one were'fool enough to give it to him.” A taient,
a great talent, an Attic talem, all mean the same sum, when Grecian

,3193 15s. of our money. See note on Andr. v. 4. 48. ——Malum

For collocaret in matrimonium. Comp. v. 1. 32. —Parviretulz‘a ‘⁴ He
