This, it is most natural to suppose, happened some time after he liud
returned home; and all these circumstances are with much greater
propriety made to fill the interval between the two acts, than huddled
into the compass of six lines. Terence, indeed, sometimes runs into
that very absurdity; but we need not industriously force him out of
his way on purpose to make him guilty of it.

For the metre of this scene, which is a mixture of Tetrameter
Trochaics, Catalectic, Acatalectic‚ and Hyper-meter, and Tetrametet
Iambics, see Hennann,Elem. D. M. pp. 105, 112. Vs. 5 is a Dimeter
Iambic.

1. Perii. [Enter Myrrhina hastily] —- Quo me vortam'? Comp.
Heaut. v. 1. 73. — Quid viro, διο. Comp. Eun. iv. 7 ΑΟ. -— 2. Visus'st.
Comp. iii. 1. 38.— 3. Ita corripuit derepente tacitus sese. “He ran
so hastily and without speaking a word.'' For ita comp. iii. 4. 9. —4.
Quod si. For nam si: “but if.” -Id clam me habuisse. “That I
concealed it.” Clam habere is the same as celare. Comp. iv. 4. 35.
Clam here is an adverb.—6. Concrepuit. Comp. Andr. iv. l. 59.—
Nulla sum. “I am undone.’'—'7. Uxor, ubi me, διο. [Enter Phi:
dippus.] —- Se eduxit. “ She withdrew.” Ἐξήγαγεν ἑαυτήν. Comp. iii·
3. 4. —— 8. Quid ais, Myrrhina ,Ρ “ Why, how now, Myrrhina? Hella,
I say !’' [Myrrhina affeets not to see him] -- Mihine. Comp. Andr. v.
2. 8.--9. Tu virum me, aut hominem deputas adeo esse ? “Do you
regard me as your husband, or even as a man ?'' Comp. Andr. iv.
3. 2.—12. Taces? Comp. Eun. iv. 4. 28.—Patrem istuc rogitare

thought the birth had been concealed from Pamphilus also.-—16.
Recte. This must not be interpreted “happily” or “well delivered;”
it respects not the mother but the child ; intimating that it was legiti-
mately begotten. Comp. iii. 3. 39; Heaut. i. 1. 107. -- Tempore*
ipso. The birth of a seven-month child was considered a timely birth
among the ancients. Comp. iii. 3. 34. -— 17. Adeon’ pervicaci esse·
animo, &c. “What! are you of such a perverse disposition,” &c.
See below, vs. 32. - 18. Eae quo. Supply puero. -— 19. Potius
quam, διο. “Rather than your daughter should be married to him
against your inclination.’' Potius seems to be redundant here, on
account of the compound praeoptares in VS. 17. Comp. Cic. Pis. c. 75

cic. Verr. ii. 4. 61: nupta eum eo. Comp. Cic. ad Div. xv. ὃς Plaut.

Quamvis causam. [Myrrhina aside ε] “Wrong as this reason is, Ι had
much rather he should suppose any reason than the true one.'’ Comp.

be a vice in youth3 for it is natural to them a11.’' Comp. Andr. v. 3.

tempus. Comp. Juvenal, vii. 343 Plaut. Bacch. iii. 3. 13. Aderit. . .
oderit. Paromoeon. This figure is a great favourite with Terence.
