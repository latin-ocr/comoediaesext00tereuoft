-10. Ex servo, διο. “From a slave Ι made you free.'' Comp.
Virg. AEn. x. 221; Manil. iv. 46. The original of this verse is still
in existence: Ἐγώ σε δοῦλον ὄντ’ ἔθηκ’ {noemam—Libertus. ‘⁸ A
freed man‚'' one who had been a slave. The children of freed men
were called libertini. Ingenui were the children of parents who had

“ always been free. — 11. Liberaliter. “ Because you served me freely,
and without compulsion.'’ — 12. Summum pretium. Liberty, “ the ·

greatest recompense'’' that could. be bestowed on a slave—13. In
memoria habeo. ‘⁴ I remember it with gratitude.’' This is the true
force of the Latin phrase. Scio would simply signify, “ I remember
it.”—Haud muto factum. “ Nor do I repent it.'' Another reading,
according to Donatus, was Haud multo factum, “ I do not condemn
the deed.'‘ Bentley readS, Haud muto.- factum gaudeo.

14. Si tibi quid. Quid for aliquid* 15. Gratum fuisse advorsum
te. “ That my services were satisfactory to you.’' · The more usual
formula is gratum fuisse tibi. Contra te would imply injury, or
offence; adversus te may be used in case of kindness, or good intent.
See Manutius on Cic. Div. ix. 22; Drakenborch on Livy, v. 35.—-—
16. Istoec commemoratio. ‘⁴ This detail, forcing your kindness on my
memory, seems to reproach me with ingratitude.'’ It was'amaxim
among the Greeks, that he who did a kindness should forget it, andv
he who received one should remember it. Here Sosia is uneasy at his
master’s mentioning the kindness he did him. The sentiments of

Terence are always just, and adapted to the characters and circum· fl

stances of the persons that speak. In Demosthenes de Cor. c. 81, we

read, Τὸ δὲ τὰς ἰδίας εὐεργεσίας ὑπομιμνήσκειν καὶ λέγειν σμικροῦ δεῖν 3

ὅμοιίν ἐστι τῷ ὀνειδίζειν. “ But putting one in mind of private kind-
nesses, and talking of thern, is almost the same as reproaching.” There
is a beautiful passage in the Dulce of Milan of Massinger, very similar.
to this of Terence. The situations of the persons are somewhat alike ;
Sforza being on the point of opening vhis mind to Francisco. The
English poet has with great address transferred the sentiment from the
inferior to the superior character, which certainly adds to its delieacy:

sforza. “ Ι have ever found you true and thankful,
Which makes me love the building I have raised

In your advancement: and repent no grace

I have conferred upon you. And believe me,

Though now I should repeat my favours to you,

It is not to upbraid you; but to tell you

I find you’re worthy of them, in your love

And service to me.”

1’8. Quin tu uno verbo dic. ‘⁴ But pray tell me at once.” — 19. Ra
faciam. “ I will be brief.”—Praedz'co tibi. ‘⁴ I will first tell you-12⁴¹
There is a particular emphasis in the word praedico. Sosia had said,
