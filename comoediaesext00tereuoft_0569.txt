proper measures had been concerted. He is, therefore, debating with
himself what is to be done. Antipho overhears him, and thence a new
source of perplexity to him. They at last, however, agree, that
Antipho should put on a bold face, and that the rest should second
him. But by the timidity of Antipho all their measures are discon-
certed, and Phaedria and Geta are left by themselves to deal in the
best manner they can with the old man.

Of this scene verses 1, 2, 13, 19—38, are Tetrameter Trochaics
Catalectic 3 vs. 12, a Tetrameter Trochaic Acatalectic, having a

Tetrameter Iambics Acatalecti03 verses 10 and 11, Tetrameter Iambics

(Glasg. 1817.) Verses 6 and 14 are Dimeter Iambics 3 vs. 16, a Mono-

the preposition in. The phrase quae res me impendet is cited from
Lucilius, by Festus, on the pronoun me. See Perizon. on Sanct. Min.

Andr. iii. 1. 10; Eun. ii. 1. 19. — 9. Laterem lavem. “ 1 should
labour in vain.’' Laterem lavare, πλίνθους πλύνειν is a Greek proverbi
signifying to labour in vain: because in “a brick,'’ as the red colour ⁵
goes quite through, all efforts to wash it away must be ineffectual.
Nannius (Mis-cell. xi. 17 ,) interprets this of “a brick not yet baked‚”
but merely dried in the sun, which the more a person endeavours to
wash, the more vain is his labour, as the brick itself is not sufficiently
hardened to prevent its dissolving away. This, says Patriek, is the
more likely, because Caesar frequently uses it in the same sense in his
Commentaries.— 10. Antipho me excruciat animi. “Antipho distracts
my mind ; '’ i. e. I am grieved on account of Antipho. Comp. Heaut.
