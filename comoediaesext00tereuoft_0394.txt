356 HEAUTON TIMORUMENOS.

Pnonocun.

This discourse, which is not strictly according to the law of prologues,
but intended against Lucius Lavinius, informs the audience of what it
is necessary for them to knowz aims at disposing them in the poet's
favour; and removes every thing that may, through mistake‚ be ob-
Jected against him. Its chief design is to prevail with the audience to
give the poet a fair and quiet hearing—the strongest incentive to great
geniuses to exert themselves for the entertainment of the public.

This, like all the prologues of Terence, consists of TrImeter Iambics.

1. Partes. “ The office‘' ofpronouncing the prologue. Comp. Hor.
Od. i. 2. 29. This was generally performed, not by the first person who
appeared in the first act, but by some young man, who was more likely
to gain the favour of the audience. Here Ambivius‚ the master of the
company, though an old man, is appointed to undertake this part. —
3. Id primum dicam .· deinde quod veni eloquar. Critics observe here,
says Patrick‚ that Terence contradicts himself ; because the speaker of
the prologue begins with the reason of his coming, and afterwards
shows that he had that part assigned to him. Hence Guyetus and
Palmerius invert the order of the words, and read, Id dicam deinde .·
primum quod veni eloquar. But all this proceeds from their mistaking
the poet’s design; for what follows aster this, to the tenth verse, is
only a general account of the play, to give the audience some notion
of it, and ought to be regarded as a parenthesis. Thence, to the six-
teenth verse, he discharges the first part of his promise3 and, from
that to the end, tells the reason of his coming. This Ι take to be the
real explication of this obscure passage3 but as Bentley’s conjecture
here ‘is very singular and curious, I will lay it before the reader at
length. Aster mentioning the correction of Guyetus, he adds, that
they who expect to meet with what he intends by eloquar quod vem' in
the Prologue, are in great error. The persons who pronounced the
prologue immediately afterwards retired, to make way for the old men
who were to begin the play. On the other hand, Ambivius, who speaks
the prologue here, is again to appear in the first scene, in the character
of Chremes ; nor does he quit the stage. This, therefore, is what
Ambivius would say: I arn first to tell you why the poet has made
choice of me, rather than a young man, to speak the prologue. And
this is what he does all along3 that, as being an old player‚ known and
acceptable to the people, he may plead the poet's cause against those
who endeavoured maliciously to detract from his merit. Deinde, quod
veui, eloquar. This is the second part, and refers to what he was to do
as an actm-3 for immediately after pronouncing the prologue, the
other actor, who personated} Menedemus, entering, begins, Quanquam
haee iuter nos, διο. - Quod veni. Supply propter.

4. Ex integra Graeca. “ From a Greek comedy never before trans-
lated.’' Comp. Andr. Prol. 10. Eugraphius says, “ taken wholly from

, a single play,’‘ and not composed of two, like the Andria. But this is

the meaning which Schmieder affixes to integram comoediam, in the
latter part of the verse. —— 6. Simplex... duplici. “ A single play com·
posed from a double plot.’' The plot is double3 having two old men,
two young men, two mistresses. Duplex...simplici is read in most
editions. Scaliger supposed that Terence called this comedy duplex,
