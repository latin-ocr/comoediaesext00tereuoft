aer 1v. scama 1. 271

subjunctive active. Abibo hinc, prcesens quando promoveo parum. Hec.
iv. 4. 81. — 18. Multum. Supply promoveo. ‘⁶ Yes, a good deal.’' —-
Molestus certe ei suero. ‘⁶ At least I will give him some annoyance.”
Schmieder joins multum with molestus. Certe is frequently used in the
sense of saltem—Animo morem gessero. “ I will gratify my resent-
ment.” So gerere mihi morem, ‘⁶ to please myself‚’' Heaut. v. 1. 7 4.

19. [Enter Pamphilus and Davus] Nisi quid Di respiciunt. ‘⁶ Unless
the gods look with pity on us and befriend us.'' Quid is often ele-
gantly redundant aster si or nisi. Comp. Cic. Div. iv. 1 ς Hor. Sat. ii.
l. 78; Ovid‚ Epist. vi. 151. The gods are properly said respicere, ‘⁶ to
look down'’ on mortals with pity or favour. Comp. Cic. Att. i. 15;
Ovid, Trist. ii. 175. It is also applied to mortals. See Bentley on Hor.
Epist. i. 1. 105. -2o. Itane imprudens? “ Imprudence! do you
say?’' —- Tandem inventa'st causa. “You have then at last found a
pretext.” — Solvisti fidem. [Ironically] ‘⁶ You have kept your
promise.” When a person makes a promise, he is said fidem astringere ¹<
alicui, “ to plight his troth ;'' ⁶⁶·to pledge his word of honour ;” as in ,ἱ
the Eun. i. 2. 22; and when he performs his promise, solvere fldem, as χ
here. Comp. Cic. Div. x. 213 Val. Max. vii. 3. 5. See Duker on ¹
Flor. i. 1. p. 29. So solvere vota, ‘⁶ to perform what had been vowed.'’
Voverat, et voti solverat ante fidem, Ovid, Fast. i. 642. —- 21. Quid
tandem ? ‘⁶ What do you mean by this (tandem) at last ?'’ Pamphilus
insists upon the word tandem, “ at last,’‘ and with reason, because it is
an injurious word, and may justly give offence3 for it marks an excuse
found after a breach of promise, and therefore a false one. A real
excuse precedes the action, as being the cause of it; but a false one is
found aster it, and serves only for pretence—Ducere. “ To deceive.’' '
So in Phorm. iii. 2. 16.—-Postulas. For vis, cupis. So vs. 34; and
Adebph. ii. 2. 30. -- 22. Complacita'st tibi. “ It was then first she had
eharms for you.'’ — 23. Animum ex animo spectavi meo. ‘⁶ Judged your ῥ’
disposition by my own.'’ Spectare, “to judge,” “to estimate.'' So ι’
Eun. i. 2. 118. Comp. Virg. AEn. ix. 235; Cic. Tusc. v. 10. - 24.
Falsus es. “You are mistaken.” Comp. Sall. Jug. e. 85. — Solidum
gaudium. ⁶⁶ J oy complete.'' So, solidus dies, Hor. Od. i. l. 20.
Solidum beneficium, (Eun. v. 2. 32,) signifies ⁶⁶ a real, substantial
service.” —25. Nisi me lactasses. “Unless you had wheedled me.” χ
Laetare, from the antiquated verb laoio, signifies ⁶⁶ to deceive with fair 1
words.'' Comp. v. 4. 9. -— Et falsa spe produceres. ‘⁶ And deluded me
with idle hopes.'' — 26. Habeas. [With great anger and indignation.]
‘⁶ We113 take her.'' -— Habeam? ‘⁶ Ι take her? ” — Quantis in malis
verser! “In what misery I am involved.’' — 27. Quantasque, δίο.
“ How many cares this slave has brought upon me, my torturer here.”
Confecit for confecerit, and this for the simple fecerit. See Cort. on
sa} Jug. c. 4. In a similar manner conficere for facere occurs Heaut-
v. . 1.

30. Scio. [Ironically‚] ‘⁶ Oh yeS, Ι know it all.’' -Altercasti. An
antique form for altercatus es. Altercarz' properly signifies to contend
in argument one with another. Hence to carry on a noisy disputa,
“to wrangle.'’ — Dudum. “Just now.'’ —- 32. Immo etiam, quo tu
minus, διο. “ Nay then, to show you how little you conceive of my
distress, these nuptials were mere semblanee, mockery all, nor was a
wife intended me.” Donatus thinks quo is put for quod, and supplies
audi or accipe, explaining it, wodor-quoniam miuus scis, &tx- Madame ¹·
