2. Thais mea. Θαῒς ἐραστοῦ τινος αὐτοῦ ἀλαζόνος, κ. r. λ. Athen.
Deipn. xiii. p. 89. — 3. Quid agitur? “How do you ‹lo 2 '’ Quid
agis and quid agitur are synonymous. Comp. ii. 2. 403 Adelph. iii.
3. 20. —- Ecquid nos amas. “ Do you love me in the least? '’ — 4. De
fidicina istac. “For sending you that music·girl.’' De sor propter .-
propter fidicinam. ·-—— Quam venuste J quod dedit, Sco. [Parmeno aside :]
‘⁶ How polite! What a fine commencement he has made at first
meeting 2 ’² Dare for facere is not unusual with the poets. The
reprehension of Parmeno here is just; for in offices of kindness it
belongs to him who receives, to remember ; he that gives should seem
to forget. -— 5. Plurimum merito tuo. Supply amo te. “ Yes, for your
own worth I love you.''-— 6. Hem alterum. [Parmeno aside ε] “ There's
the other for you! '’-— 7. Abdomini hunc natum dicas. ‘⁴ One would ¹
swear he was born sor his belly.'' Thus Cicero in Pison. c. 17. Ille
gurges atque helluo ,- natus abdomini sua, non laudi atque gloria. Tre-
bellius Gallieno, c. 16. Natus abdomini et voluptatibus, &a Before
this reading had been restored by Dr. Bentley, all the printed editions
exhibited Ex homine hunc natum dicas. ‘⁶ He is so like Thraso, one
would think he was his son,'' i. e. both are so silly, one would think
this parasite his second sels. ‘⁴ Like master, like man-'⁹ The gene-
rality of commentators understood this as said interrogatively : “ who
would imagine that he was born of a human being? '’ Some render
it, “A chip of the old block.” That Dryden understood it in this
sense, is evident from the following passage in his Essay on Dramatic
Poetry .·——“ In the new comedy of the Grecians the poets sought
indeed to express the ‘’'HOos‚ as in their tragedies the ndens, of
mankind. But this contained only the general characters of men and
manners3 that is, one old man or father, one lover, one courtezm, so
like another, as if the first ofthem had begotten the rest of every sort;
ex homine hunc natum dicas.'‘ — A bdcmini must be pronounced in three
syllables, abdomni. Comp. Hec. iii. 1. 1. —- Ubi vis, non moror.
“ When you please, Ι am no hindrance.'' Ubi vis, says Donatus, is an
answer to eamus ad coenam, and non moror to quid stas ?

8. Adibo. [Parmeno to himseffi]—9. Ituran'. [Parmeno goes up
to Thais] —- 10. Bene fecisti. “You are welcome.’' Donatus asks
what Parmeno had done to deserve this: as Thais was going out,
and at that time standing in the very entrance, when she sees Par—
meno. “You have done well in coming just now, if you wanted to see
me, for I was about leaving horne ε had you come later you would not
have found me at home.” Thais knew from what Phaedria had said
{i- 2. 109.) that Parmeno would be coming with the slaves. Benesacis
is a formula of returning thanks. Comp. 1. 2. 106; v. 8. 54. ·- Quid,
hunc non vides? [To Parmeno in an under voice] -11. Video et me
taedet. “Yes, 1 see him, to my sorrOW.” [Parmeno says this in an
under voice. , The remainder os the verse he speaks aloud.] — 12. Quid
stamus ? [ssraso angrily,] “ Why do we loiter here ‘l '' - 13. Pace tua.
“With your permission.'’ Donatus observes upon this, that there is a
particular elegance in the choice of the poet's words3 because par,
¹datzo, deditio, conventio, colloquium, are words proper to war. They are
used sor the purpose of sneering at the captain. - 14. Convenire et
colloqui. “ To treat and parley with her.’' Comp. Andr. ii. 2. 29. —-
15. Perpulchra credo dona. [Ironically]

16. Res indicabit. “ The gifts will answer for themselves.'' Comp.
