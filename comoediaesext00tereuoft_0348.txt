40. Summum suum. Supply amicum. Comp. Adelph. iii. 2. 54ς
Phorm. i. 1. 1. - Quid agitur ? The whole address is an affectation of
friendship, to render the other ridiculous; and the latter part of it is not
so properly asking a question, as a fiattering insinuation of his concern
for him. The proper meaning of quid agitur? is “How do you do? ”
But Parmeno archly takes it in a literal sense, “ What are you doing 2 ”
and answers accordingly, Statur, “ Ι am standing.” Colman translates
the question and answer thus: “ GNAT. What are you upon? PAR.
My legs.⁷' There is much the same kind of conceit in Shakespeare:

“ FALSTAFF. My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.

Prs'ror.. Two yards and more.''
Merry Wives of Windeor, Act 1. Sc. 2.

—- 41. Credo. “ I do believe you.’' Schmieder thinks this is said
ironically, in the sense of “ I thank you,” as in Phorm. ii. 1. 25. See
note on Andr. v. 4. 36. -— 42. Qui dum ,7 “ Wherefore? why do you
ask?’'——Ne sis: sed, διο. ’ “Well, do not be so! but what do you
think of this slave?'' Quid for quale. Comp. Andr. i. 1. 2Ο; iv· 2.
19. Slaves taken in war were called mancupia, or mancipia, probably ,
as being manu capti. Hence mancupium, or mancipium, came to signify
any just and lawful possession, or whatever a person had property in, as
his slaves, δια-43. Uro hominem. [GnathQ hay-asidet] “I have
nettled the rascal.” Comp. iii. 1. 48 ; Sueton. Tib. c. 66. — Ut salsus
animi est! [Parmeno half-aside :] “How the knave’s deceived!”
For this he uses falsus es, Andr. iv. i. 24. The genitive animi is put
for animo. See the commentators on Livy, vi. 10. -44, Hoc nunc
dicis, &c. “ By this you would insinuate that we are shut out. Alas!
there is a change in all things.” Schmieder refers hoo here to munere,
and interprets it propter hoc munus. '

47. Sursum, deorsum. ’‘Avw κάτω. Deorsum is a dissyllable here by
synaeresis. Comp. Adelph. iv. 2. 35. — 48. Ecquid beo te? “ Come,
don’t I make you happy?'’—- Men’? papae ,7 [Ironically] “ Me? oh!
wonderfully so.'’ —- Sic soleo amicos. “ 'Tis my way with my friends.”
Beare, ‚or beatos reddere, is to be supplied. — 49. Profectus alio fueras.
“You were going, perhaps, somewhere else.'' This is said to draw a
confession from him, that he had come to the house of Thais, but
could not gain admission. Comp. Andr. iii. 4. 21. - 50. Tum tu igitur
paululum, διο. “May Ι beg you then to use your interest here, and
introduce me ?” Dare operam alicui signifies “to assist a person.”
Comp. Phorm. i. 2. 37. —-51. Quia istam ducis. [Pointing to Pam-
philos] “ Because you are bringing her.'' —- 52. Num quem, διο.
This he says insinuating that Parmeno could not himself obtain ad-
mission. [Exit Gnatho] — Sine biduum, διο. Parmeno, now lest
alone, utters these three lines* while Gnatho is going into the house of
Thais. He pronounces them slowly‚ and with an air that demonstrantes
his contempt of the parasite, and his confidence that he shall soon be
able to triumph over him. After which he walks u and down upon the
stage, meditating, and making some gestures, to l up the scene, till
Gnatho comes out from offering the present to Thais. —— 53. Qui mihi.
Mihi is elegantly redundant. Comp. Phorm. v. 8. 21.- Uno digitulo.
The same as facillime. See Cic. Taso. Qu. iv. 31.—-54. Faxo. “1
warrant you.'' — Calc-ibus. Aristoph. Nub. 136. Ἀπεριμερίμνυς τὴν
θύραν λελάκτικας. Comp. Plaut. Paen iv. 1. 3.
