246 ANDRIA.

the most laboured character in the Conscious Lovers, it is much inferior
to Pamphilus. Of the two, Bevil is the more cool and refined ς Pam-
philus the more natural and pathetic.
This scene is a mixture of various Trochaics and Iambics.
1. Hoccine, &a [Pamphilus to himself, exclaiming against his father
and Chremes. He does not see Mysis till after vs. 31.] — 2. Quid illud
, est ? [Mysis asida] ——Pro Deum fldem. Supply obtestor. This is an
3' exclamation usual not only in cases of great astonishment and admira-
: tion, but also whenever a man thinks himself injured. The form of
s words is sometimes varied. Comp. Phor-m. ii. 3. 4; Adelph. iii. 4. l;
Sall. Cat. c. 10. — Si hoc non contumelia 'st? Ταῦτ’ οὐχ ὕβρις δῆτ’ ἐστίν,
Aristoph. Nub. 1302. The common editions have si haec. Ruhnken
agrees with Bentley in preferring hoc, which is supported as well by the
authority of Donatus, as of several MSS. Thus, campus arenoe, quod
modo pontus erat, Ovid. Met. ii. 262; non est illud liberalitas, Senec. de
Benef. ii. 8. —3. Uxorem decrerat. For si uxorem decreverat. Comp.
Heaut. iii. 1. 783 Virg. AEn. vi. 31. The same ellipsis is usual in
English z “ Had he decreed,'’ &c. The present dare is put here for the
future daturum esse. Comp. iii. 5. 7 ; Caes. B. G. iv. 21 ; Livy, ii. 5.
—Nonne oportuit praescisse me ante Ρ “Was it not his duty that I
should previously know it ?'’ The preposition ante is redundant. See
the commentators on Livy, ii. 20. — 5. Verbum. Put here for sermonem,
as in the Ean. i. 2. 95. This verse is a Dimeter Iambic. ——6. Quid
ἱ Chremes? “What shall I say of Chremes?” See Phorm. i. 2. 97;
l Duker on Flor. ii. 6. — 7. Immutatam. ‘⁶ Unchangeable.'’ sse verb
⁴ immutare every where else signifies “to change.'' Westerhovius and
others think immutatam put here for immutabilem. ·—— 8. Itane obstinate.
“ Can he be so obstinately bent upon tearing me from Glycerium 2³³

-- 9. Quod si fit, διο. A Dimeter Iambic. — 10. Adeon’ hominem esse ’

¹ invenustam ,Ρ “ Was ever man so crossed, so cursed as I 'N’ The in-
} finitive esse is put here absolutely, as is frequently the case in bursts of
f indignation and admiration. Comp. iv. 3. 1; v. 2. 29. Invenustus here,
according to Muretus, signifies ‘⁴ crossed in love.'’ Ruhnken thinks it
means ‘⁴ unlucky,’' and is a metaphor from dice-playing,'' in which the
most lucky throw was termed Venus. Comp. Hec. v. 4. 8. — ll. Pro
J Deam, διο. A Dimeter Trochaic wanting the last syllable. — 12. Affi—
nitatem. This properly signifies relationship by marriage ; and so it is
generally taken here. Ruhnken, however, understands it as “ the com-
pact'’ between Simo and Chremes.-— 13. contemtus, spretus. “Despised
and held in scorn.’' Spretas, as Ruhnken observes, is a more forcible
word than contemtus. See Broukhus. on Tibull. i. 4. 77. —Facta‚
transacta omnia. “ All done, concluded all.” A formula in use with

, lawyers, signifying that nothing had been omitted that could contribute

³ to the completion of the business in hand. Comp. Cic. Catil. iii. 6. -
14. Nisi si. Si here is elegantly redundant. Comp. Adelph. iv. 3. 3 3
Ovid Epist. iv. 111; Livy, vi. 263 see Duker on Flor. iv. 7.—15.
Aliquid monstri alunt. “ For I must suspect they rear up some mon-
ster.'' Childrenvhaving any monstrous deformity were usually brought
,τ up in secret. Pamphilus, in the height of his grief, began to suspect
’ that Chremes' daughter must have been monstrously deformed, other-
' wise she would not have been thus forced upon him. Terence seems
to have had these lines of Menander in view: Περιάξω τὴν ἐμαυτοῦ
θυγατέρα, Τὴν πόλιν ὅλην· οἱ βουλόμενοι ταύτην λαθεῖν Λαλεῖτε. “ I
