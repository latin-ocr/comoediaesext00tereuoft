ACT V. Sann ΙΙ.

In this scene, while Laches and Bacchis are jointly contriving how
to make up matters between the disagreeing parties, and remove all
J‘ealousies and suspicions, Phidippus appears with the nurse. Laches
informs him of what has passed, and of the innocence of Bacchis:
which he, not too forward to believe at first, is, however, convinced of,
and approves of the project of her going in to satisfy the women.

This scene consists of Tetrameter Iambics Catalectic‚ except the first
four words, which are scanned with the last verse of the former scene.

addresses ι] “ Ι will not suffer you to want any thing at my house.”
