no excuse at all, because, however fortune might deprive him of his
estate, she had no power over his mind, nor could weaken those
abilities by which he might, if he would exert himself, retrieve his
ruined circumstances. — Viden’ me ex eodem ortum loco? διο. This

acquaintance. “But I am of an unhappy temper, and can neither
bear to be made ridiculous, nor submit to blows.'’ There were
anciently two kinds of parasites. One who, on account of their witty
sayings, were entertained at the tables of the great, to divert the
company. Another, who earned a livelihood by submitting to blows
and all manner of indignities. This poor wretch tells Gnatho that he
is not fit to be of either of these kinds. The parasite, for encourage-
ment, tells him that these are an antiquated race, now no more heard
οἷς and that there was a third kind, of his invention, not exposed to
any ill usage, nor made the jest of the company, but who studied to
ingratiate themselves with men of fortune, by humouring them in
every thing, and pretending to admire whatever they said or did. ,
