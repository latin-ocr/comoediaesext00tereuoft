ACT III. Scmm IV.

Antipho is here artfully introduced by the poet, that Chaerea, meet-
ing him as he came out from Thais, might give him an account of what
is supposed to have been transacted behind the scenes. This is done
that the audience may learn by a recital, what the poet could not with
decency exhibit upon the stage.

The metre is Tetrameter Iambic Catalectic.

1. Heri aliquot, ὅτε. “ Yesterday a few of us young fellows assem-
bled at Piraeus.’' There has been a great dispute about this verse,
whether we ought to read in Piraeo or in Pit-ceum. Madame Dacier says,
the true reading may be easily ascertained by incontestable reasons.
If the youths who had agreed to sup together were to go from the city

. , to the port, we ought undoubtedly to read in Piraeum. But as they had

been at that time on duty at the port, Terence could not write any

other than in Piraeo. Coire signifies “ to come together,” “ to assemble.”
See Virg. AEn. vii. 5823 and Heius. on Ovid, Epist. vii. 123. Piroeo.

' This port is by many written Piraeeus. See Gronov. obss. i. 3.-2.

Ut de symbolis essemus. Ἀπὸ συμβολῆς δειπνεῖν, “ to club together for
a feast.” Esset, for ederet, occurs in Virg. Geor. i. 151 ; est, AEn. iv. 66.
For symbolum, see Andr. i. 1. 61. This kind of feast was called by the
Greeks θίασος, or δεῖπνον συμφορητόν. -— C'haeream ei rei, &c. “ Elected
Chaerea master of the feast.” The magister convivii is called by Horace,
Od. ii. 7. 25, arbiter bibendi ,- and by the Greeks, συμποσίαρχος. Rei
at the end of the verse is a monosyllable. - 3. Data· annuli. “ Rings
were given.’' It was usual with the ancients to deposit their rings,
which they wore on the third finger of the left hand, as pledges for
observing an appointment. Comp. Plin. N. H. xxxiii. 1. -4. Quo
in loeo dictum ’st. “ In the appointed place.” Comp. Andr. i. 1. 75. —
Para-ti nihil est. For nihil paratum: “nothing is prepared” “no
preparation made.” The same words are used by Livy, ix. 16. So
quid integri, hoc signi, &c. -5. Homo ipse. Chaerea, the master of
the feast.

6. Hoc negoti ceteri dedere. “ The others commissioned me.” —- 7.
