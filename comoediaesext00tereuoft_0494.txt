ACT IV. Semo: VI.

Demea, after wandering over the whole town, in consequence of' the
wrong direction given him by Syrus, returns complaining of the
fatigue he had undergone, and all to no purpose; for neither could he
find his brother, nor meet with any one who had seen him. Ηε
therefore resolves to give over a vain pursuit, and wait for him at his
own house, till he comes home.

The metre is Trimeter Iambic.

Donatus takes the word obsidere here in its most general sense, a}
when it is used to signify “the investing'' or “laying siege'' to ε
town. Proprie obsidere dixit ,· convenit enim et irato, et repente aggres-
suro. But had the poet intended this, he would undoubtedly have said
domum obsidere, and not domi. Obsidere is put here for sedere, th‹
compound for the simple, as in Plaut. Pseud. iii. 2. 18; Poen. Prol. 23.
-— Usque, donec. Comp. Hec. i. 2. 50.

 

ACT IV. Scmm VII.

Micio having got every thing in readiness for the intended marriage
of his son, is going to acquaint the bride and her mother, when he' u
met by Demea, who had been seeking him so long. Hence a conver
sation begins; at first warm and passionate on the side of Demea, who
fancying his brother knew nothing of the abduction of the music· -ἰὶῐΙ
has no doubt but, when hearing it, he will be thoroughly provo ed
and no less forward than himself, m condemning this licentious youth
But Micio, who was apprised of it before, hears him with great calm-
ness, which perfectly astonishes Demea, who, therefore, tries whethe1
by raillery he can gain any thing: but the other still continuinfi
unmoved, and answering with his wonted good humour, he lamenti
with himself the destruction which he foresees coming upon his
brother’s family.
