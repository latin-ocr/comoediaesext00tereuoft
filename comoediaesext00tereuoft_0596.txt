10. The Bipont editors think Geta speaks these words aside, to the
spectators; but that they are addressed aloud to Chremes is evident,
from the answer of Demipho : ‘⁴ Therefore conduct me to him.'’ Comp.
ii. 1. 75. — 7. Transito ad uxorem, διο. “ Step over to my wife, that
she may see the girl before she goes.” — 8. Dicat, eam, &c.· {LAnd let
Nausistrata tell the girl, to prevent her being angry, that we have agreed
to give her in marriage to Phormio.” —— 9. Ipsi qai sit, &c. ‚ ‘⁶ Who is
more intimately acquainted with her than we are.”- 10. Nos nostro
officio, &c. “ That we have in no respect swerved from our duty3 and
that Phormio has received as large a portion as he demanded.” — 11.
Quid ιαα, &c. “ What, the plague, does that concern you ?” Here tua
is evidently two short syllables, and must inevitably be so scanned; and
the verse is invariably the same in all manuscripts and early editions.
If tua here be not a nominative, as Guyetus supposed, certainly it is not
an ablative. See Eun. ii. 3. 29 ; Adelph. v. 4. 27 ; and particularly the
note on Hec. iv. 3. 12. Bothe, in order to adapt this verse to the
common notion of grammarians respecting the construction of refert
and interest, reads from conjecture, quid tua autemid refert ?

12. Non satis est, διο. “ For it is not sufficient to have done your
duty, unless the world approves it.’' -l4. Idem ego istuc, &c- ‘⁸ 1 can
say al] this to the girl myself.” — Mulier mulieri magis congruet. “ But
it will come better from one woman to another.” A similar adage
ι· occurs in Plutarch : Γέρων γέροντι ’γλῶτταν ἡδίστην ἔχει, παῖς παιδὶ, καὶ
; ’γυναικὶ προσφορὰν γυνή. We say, ‘⁴ Likeloves like.”—15. Rogabo. “Well
’ then, Ι will ask your wife to tell her.” [Exeunt Demipho and Getoe]— Ubi
ego illas, &c. This is to be understood of his Lemnian wife and daughter.
He knew they were in Athens, but was quite a stranger te their adventures.
Having, therefore, now settled every thing for annulling the former
marriage, and making way for that of his daughter, he naturally begins
to think how he shall find her out, which was only wanting to complete
his designs. This is intended as a transition to the next scene. Colman
thinks it would have been better. if it had followed without this kind os
introduction. The scene itself, he adds, is admirable, and is, in many
places, both affecting and comic 3 and the discovery of the real character
of Phanium is made at a very proper time.

This scene is very interesting. Here a discovery is made that removes
our fears for Antipho and his much-loved bride. The several incidents
that lead to it, will easily appear from what has been already remarked
on former scenes, and, therefore, require not to be enlarged on here.
It will be sufficient merely to observe, that in the beginning of thia
s tene, the poet has designed, by introducing Sophrona complaining oi
her missortunes, and representing every thing in the most unfavourable
light, that the reader may be the more sensible of the sudden change
occasioned by her meeting with Chremes, from sorrow and despair to
'o and ho e. “ ’
