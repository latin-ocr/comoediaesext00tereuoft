ACT IV. Semne VIII.

Bacchis was, by this time, gone over to Menedemus, and Clinia had
applied to his father to obtain for him Chremes' daughter. The old
man, overjoyed at this supposed reformation in his son, is represented
here just coming out, and talking to himself, and declaring that he is
now happy to find his son quite another man. Chremes, who over-
hears him, and continues still in the error taken notice of in the
preceding seeneS, wonders at his mistake, forgetting so soon what had
been contrived between them3 and at last, by entering seriously into
conversation with him, endeavours to make him sensible of the whole
plot, which, though Menedemus is persuaded to believe, he still
persists in his resolution of indulging his son for the present.

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.
