positive, where so many conjectures have already been offered and
rejected. But if one may determine from the context, which is com-
monly the best way, as well as the most natural and obvious, it should
seem that Demea means to give an order to one of his servants to give
AEschinus twenty minae. He has already determined to be very
generous3 ⁴and. another instance of his bounty occurs in the concluding
scene, where he pays down the money for the freedom of Phrygia. —
In ‘this very speech he is pleasantly considering with himself the
expense, which he disregards, so as he can but get into favour. ⁷ In
consequence of which resolution it is natural to suppose, that he
immediately gives an order for issuing money to defray the charges of
pulling down walls, entertaining company, &c. Jube. See vs. 10.

ACT V. Scmm VIII.

Syrus, according to Demea’s order, is busy in throwing down the
garden-wall: Micio observing it, inquires the reason3 and under-
standing that it is by his brother's order, wonders at the sudden change,
and comes out to be satisfied whether it is so really. The meeting of
the two brothers occasions quite anew scene; for Demea, carrying
every thing to excess, is not satisfied with bringing over the whole
family, and joining the two houses in one3 but will have Micio marry
the bride's mother. AEschinus too joins in the request, and with much
difficulty he is at last persuaded to consent.

Of this scene, verses 1—10, 33, and 34, are Trimeter Iambics ; and
vss. 11-32, Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic.

1. Jubet frater ? [Micio entering :] “ My brother order it, do you
say ?” Micio, it appears, asked Syrus, Cur maceriam diruis ? To which
Syrus replied‚ Quia frater jubet tuus. Comp. v. 7. 18. - 2. Hac re.

refers colere to the nurse3 adjuvare to Hegio; and adjungere to Sostrata.

Ita aiunt is sometimes used when a person is not willing to admit, but
is rather inclined to deny, an assertion. See note on Hec. v. l. 22.
