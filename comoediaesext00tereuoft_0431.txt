8; Phorm. Prol. 17. We are here to suppose Syrus endued with a
great share of penetration. He already understood the disposition of
both the old men, and what were their several designs; and had formed
in his mind the whole plot he was going to put in execution. From
what had passed between Chremes and him, he knew that whatever was
said to Menedemus, would with the other pass for a story formed to
impose upon him; so that when the whole truth was told to Menedemus,
were he again to repeat it to Chremes, it would gain no credit, as Syrus
would beforehand inform him that all this was said with no other view
but to make Clinia easy with his father. And we find that this accord-
ingly happens, till Menedemus at length, by reasons that are irresistible,
oonvinces Chremes that it is the truth. This scheme, it must be
owned, is well concerted, and shows great cunning in the contriver.
No wonder then if Syrus is so highly pleased with it, and talks of it in

so boasting a manner. — Me effero. The same as me jacto, or glorior : '

‘⁴ Ι boast.” Comp. Flor. i. 26. — 33. Cum. For etsi.

36. Non committet. Supply mihi: “He will not grant me his

daughter.’‘ Comp. Andr. i. 5. 6. — 37. Quid me fiat. Τί μοι γένοιτο.
The usual phrase is, quid de me fiat. —- Parvi pendis. Some MSS. and
ancient editions have parum curas, which is a mere interpretation of

these words. Comp. Hec.iii. 5. 63. ——- 38. Malum. An interjection: ἕ

“ Why, the plague Σ do you think I would have you counterfeit for ever ?”

— AEtatem. Comp. Eun. iv. 5. 8. — Id assimularier. Comp. ii. 3. 91, 92.

- 39. ZUnus est dies, διο. “ But a single day, to give me time to bubble

Chremes of the money . . . Peaoe! not an hour more.” Dum for quoad.

For pax! see note on ii. 3. 50. - 40. Tantum sat habes? ‘⁶ Do you

think so short a space sufficient ?’' Tantum sometimes diminishes.
