It is more probable that Sostrata means z “ Do you pretend that I shall

find it easy to convince Clitipho of his being my son, because of his

resembling our daughter so lately found?'’ What follows makes it

probable that resemblance is here meant3 for Chremes immediately

answers; “N03 but because he resembles you.” On this Colman

observes: I cannot agree with any of these commentators, and think

that the whole difficulty of the passage here, as in many other places?
is entirely of their own making. Sostrata could not refer to the reply

of Chremes, because she could not possibly tell what it would be: but

her own speech is intended as an answer to his preceding one, which

she takes as a sneer on her late wonderful discovery of a daughoer;

imagining that he means to insinuate that she could at any time, with

equal ease, make out the proofs of the birth of her som—19. Nil

ACT V. Senm: IV.

This scene is a continuation of what was begun in the foregoing.
Clitipho comes up, and persists in demanding of his mother that she
would tell him his real parents. Chremes interrupts that discourse,
and chides his son in the bitterest terms for his debaucheries; but at
the same time with such strength of reason, and so lively a description
of the infamy of his behaviour, as convinces him how much he had been
in the wrong, and makes him ashamed of himself and his own actions.

This scene consists of Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic.

Here we have the style somewhat more elevated and raised than is
usual in comedy. This proceeds from the passion of the speaker,
which, as it warms the soul, suggests at the same time expressions and
sentiments, more noble than those which are apt to offer themselves
when the mind is cool and calm. It is generally imagined that this is
the passage alluded to by Horace, when he says,
