Ac‘r Π. SCENE 11. 309

24. Dum hoec loquimur. [Gnatho still to himseffl] - Interea loci. Loci
here is redundant. Comp. i. 2. 46 ; Andr. i. 1. 90. —Macellum The
mal-ket, where all kinds of provisions were sold. See Sueton. Caes.
c. 26. -25, Cupediarii. “ Confectioners;’⁷ from cupedia, “ sweet
cakes‚'' which they made and sold. Bentley writes cuppediarii ‚· the
old editions have cupedinarii. —26. Cetarii. “Fishmongers;'' pro-
perly venders of all kinds of large salt fish. —Fartorem “ Sausage-
makers.'' Fartor in Colum. viii. 7. is used for “a poulterer.’' See
Burmann on Petron. c. 79.—27. Quibus et re salva et perdita pro-
fueram et prosum saepe. “ Who, while my means were large, oft profited,
· and, though now wasted‚ profit by me still.'’ Saepe must be joined

with profueram. This confused order of words is called Synclzisis. —
28. Adventum gratulantur. ⁴⁶ They bid me welcome.’'-30. Tam
facile victum quaerere. ⁴‘ Ι got my bread so easily.''- 31. De me. For
ex me. So Cic. Att. i. 11 ; i. 14. -—- Sectari jussi. “ I bade him follow
me.'’ This alludes to the manner of the ancient philosophers, who
went followed by a ‘crowd of their disciples, hence called sectatores and
sectae. —32. Si potis est. The order of these words is this : Ut parasiti
item vocentur Gnathonici, si potis est fieri, tanquam discipuli philosophorum
habent vocabula ex ipsis philosophis. “ That parasites, if possible, may,
in like manner, be called Gnathonies‚ as the followers of philosophers
take their names from the founders.” Petis est, the ancient form for
potest. Comp. Adelph. iv. 1. 5 3 Lucr. ii. 849; Catull. lxv. 23. Some
read here disciplinae, “ the sects‚” or “ schools.'' So Cic. Nat. Deor. i. 7 ;
Fin. ii. 11 ; Lactant. ii. 8.

, 34. Viden'otium, &c. [Parmeno aside:] “ Mark what ease, and
, being kept at other's eost, produces !”-Sed ego cesso. This is the only
>scene in Terence, says Diderot, which I remember, that can be

charged with being superfluous. Thraso has made a present to Thais
of a young girl. Gnatho is to carry her. Going along with her, he
amuses himself with giving the spectators a most agreeable eulogium
on his profession. But was that the time for it? Let Gnatho pay
due attention on the stage to the young woman whom he is charged
with, and let him say what he will to himself, Ι consent to it. -36.
Ostium hic. No elision here on account of the caesura: ium is an
Iambus. — 37. Rivalis servom. Rivales were shepherds‚ who had
water from the same spring or brook, quasi eodem rivo utentes. Hence
> those who loved the same mistress. — Salva res. This Gnatho says in
consequence of seeing Parmeno standing outside the door of Thais,
like one who had no hopes of getting admission.—-Hice homines frigent.
“ These men have met with a cold reception.'' Frigus andfrigeo are
words often used in cases of lost favour. Comp. Hor. Sat. ii. 1. 61;
Sueton. Aug. c. 66; Pers. i. 108. Hice, i. e. Izi homines, as in the
next verse. —38. Nebulonem hunc certum’st ludere. ‘⁶ I am deter-
mined to play upon this knave.’' Nebulo is derived from nebula, “a
cloud‚'' denoting a man of no value, unstable as a cloud, or who
by lying and artifice endeavours to throw a cloud over things. In the
same manner tenebrio is derived from tenebrae. Nebulones and tene-
’ 'briones are persons who love darkness and hate the light. Homer, Il.
Γ. 11, speaking of a mist, says κλέπτῃ δέ τε νυκτὸς ἀμέινω. - Hice.
[Parmeno assides] “These, Thraso and his parasite.'’ —Hoc munere.
By presenting Pamphila to Thais. — 39. Suam. “ All their own.'’ —
Comp. Andr. v, 6. 12.
