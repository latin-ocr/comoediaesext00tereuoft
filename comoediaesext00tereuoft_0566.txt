ACT Ι. Sem: 111. ¹

This scene furnishes a very useful lesson, that though we are apt to
covet pleasures without regar-d to consequences, yet, whenx the enjoy·-
ment is over, and reason resumes her province, we are then sensible of

our rashness, and regret that our choice is not equally free as at first. ⁷
Hence an essential maxim to our happiness, that, before we yield to 2

the impetuosity of passion, we weigh impartially every cirmmatanoe.
