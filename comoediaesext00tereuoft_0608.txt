Phormio and the old men would be much more comio in the repre-

that Phormio addresses himself solely to Demipho and Chremes, and
that the imperatives used by themselves also are in the singular number,
and may, therefore, most naturally be supposed to be addressed to each
other, while in conflict with Phormio, without the aid of servants.
The foregoing remark is from Colman.

ACT V. SCENE VIII.

Phormio, finding he cannot force his way to Nausistrata, has
recourse to his voice. Nausistrata hearing herself called, runs out 'to
see what is the matter. This causes the discovery of all; whence en-
sues much resentment on the side of Nausistrata, and much anguish
and vexation on that of Chremes. Demipho acts the part of mediator,
and at last brings Nausistrata to temper. Phormio, in the mean tIme,
who is anxious for himself and Phaedria, interposes, and owns that he
has received money of the old man, and to what purpose he had em-
ployed it. Nausistrata, who is partia] towards her son, leaves all to
his determination, and invites Phormio to supper. Here the ‘poet
concludes, leaving the spectators to supply the rest.

Of this scene, verses 1-21, are Trimeter Iambics3 the remainder.
are Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic.
