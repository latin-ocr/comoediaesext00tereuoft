character, whether real ‘or affected, is in itself so extraordinary, that it
required all the art of Terence to bring it about3 and the only probable
method of effecting it, is to suppose it the result, at least, of some little
deliberation, and reflection on the inconveniences he had experienced
stom a contrary temper. Donatus observes the great art with which
Terence has preserved the gradation of Demea's anger and distresses,
'which can be pushed no further than the discovery of Ctesiph03 and
this ,admirable climax of incidents is finely completed in the scene
with which I have closed the fourth act. To say the truth, the fable
itself, in a manner, ends there 3 and though there is much humour and
pleasantry in the remaining part of the play, yet many good critics have
objected to it. Terence, however, or rather Menander, must be allowed
to have shown an uncommon effort of genius, if not of judgment, in
these adscititious sceness which he has founded on the conversion of
Demea: a circumstance which grows out of the foregoing incidents,
and supplies the materials for a pleasant fifth act, like the giving away
the ring-s in Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice ; in which play also,
as well as this of Terence, the main business of the plot is concluded in
the fourth act. Thus far Colman. Schmieder commences the fifth act
at Discrucior animi, (iv. 4. 1) ; and concludes the play with ei rei hunc
sumamus diem (v. 3. 68). Of the remaining six soenes he forms a sepa-
rate piece, which he entitles Drama secundarium, and of which the
present scene, Nunquam ita quisquam, διο. constitutes the prologue. —
Nunquam ita quisquam, 8ῑο. Constr. Nunquam quisquam fuit praeditus
ratione ita bene subducta ad vitam instituendam, διο. “ Never was man
possessed of so fair a plan, so wise a rule of life,'’ &c. The syntax here
is the same as in Eun. i. 2. 43 Heant. v. 1. 10. So simus ea mente,
Cic. ad Div. vi. 1. Subducere rationes is an arithmetica] phrase, signi—
fying “to cast up and balance accounts.” Comp. Cic. Att. v. ult.;
Plaut. Capt. i. 2. 89; Carc. iii. 1. 13 Colum. v. 2. Hence a person is
said, metaphorically‚ subducta esse ratione, who meditates with himself,
and devises some useful plan. Comp. Cic. ad Div. i. 9. Demea means,
that no man has so well regulated and laid down in his own mind the
plans of life, but that in course of time he will often find reason to
change his measures3 to approve what he had rejected, and reject what
he had approved. — Ad vitam. Perlet explains the preposition by qaod
attinet, citing Cic. V err. iii. 22.>

“Than complaisance and mildness.” Donatus makes this distinction
between facilitas and clementia, that the former is the property of a per-

one who is never angry.
