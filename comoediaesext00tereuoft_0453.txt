at which he valued her should be immediately paid, and threatened to
sell her to another, Ctesipho, reduced to the highest despair, was
deliberating with himself about leaving his country, when AEschinus,
whom neither fear nor shame held in awe, understanding the matter,
forcibly enters that person’s house, and after beating and abusing him
and his family, carries off the girl, and gives her to his brother. The
noise of this accident soon runs through the city. Demea comes to town,
accuses his brother, exclaims and appeals to gods and men, that it was
wholly through Micio's fault that AEschinus was become so dissolute,
intemperate, given to wine and women, and, in a word, had abandoned
himself to every thing that was bad. He thanked the gods, that the one
at least, who lived in the country with him, was temperate and frugal,
minded both his fortune and reputation, and never so much as thought
of those excesses3 so great was the difference between his manner o'f
training up his son, and his brother's. Micio endeavours to pacify
him, and had actually accomplished it, when another accident fell out,
which raised yet greater disturbances. The story of the music-girl,
whom AEschinus had carried off by force, is brought to the mother of
Pamphila, who was so far gone with child, that she was at this very
time in labour. What could the wretched mother do? She imagined
that AEschinus’ mind was changed, and she and her ‚ daughter perfidi-
ously abandoned. She sends Geta, a servant, who alone supported, in
the best manner he could, that distressed family, to Hegio a relation of
Pamphila, and orders him to lay the case before him as it really was.
Meantime, Demea had heard that his own Ctesipho too was present at
the outrage ε and now he was all in a ferment, when Syrus, a slave of.
great cunning, contrives a tale to bring him to temper3 that Ctesipho
‘indeed had come from the country, but with a design to reproach
AEschinus3 that he had said a great many severe things to him in the
public forum, and afterwards returned to the country, to mind his
employment there. Demea could scarce refrain from team, and con·
gratulated himself that he had one son, at least, who was an example
of his father's strictness. In his return to the country he chauces to
meet with Hegio, by whom he is informed of the violence offered to
Pamphila by AEschinus. Again being put into a rage, while he is in
quest of his brother, upon whom he may vent all his ill-humour, he
meets with one coming from the country, of whom inquiring con-
eerning his son, he learns that he is not at home. He returns to
Syrus, by whom a new fiction is formed to stop his mouth. He
then asks where he is most likely to find his brother; and receives

- such an answer, that the unfortunate old man, giving too much credit

to him, in vain hunts after him over all the city. Meantime, Micio,
informed of every thing by Hegio, had himself gone to the women,
soothed their affliction, removed their tears, and put an end to all their

riefs, by promising that he would confirm, the marriage between

the slaves unawares names Ctesipho: when, rushing suddenly into-
the house, he finds him, whom-he believed minding his business in the
country, sitting and drinking with his mistress. This makes him
perfectly furious. Having vented his rage, he is at length so far
sostened, by a peaceable and mild speech of Micio, that, laying aside
his wonted severity, he thinks of becoming courteous, affable, and
