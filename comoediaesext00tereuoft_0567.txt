und cast up the balance fairly, taking this for our rule, Nocet emta
dolore voluptas. Antipho, before his marriage with Phanium, would
have made any sacrifice to obtain her3 but now he envies Phaedria, who,
though still disappointed in his wishes, has it yet in his power to make
a free choice, and proceed or retreat as he may find most expedient.

Antipho’s speech, which had been interrupted by Phaedria’s contemp-
tuous audio. — Quam mox. For quam cito. The poet here makes
Antipho, amidst all his perplexity, behave with great propriety.
What he says here is extremely well-judged, and necessary to prevent
the audience from suspecting that all these fine reflectione, and this
concern he seemed to be in, proceeds from some disgust at her he
had so fondly wished for. This must have made him appear in a very
disadvantageous light, as capricious‚ fickle, and unsteady. But here,
on the contrary, we see that it is partly from respect to his father,
whom he could not bear to offend, partly from an apprehension of
losing what of all things he held most dear: and as both these are
indications of a good disposition, they of course beget impressions and
wishes in his favour; a thing of great consequence, and never to be
neglected by a poet in his favour-ite characters.
