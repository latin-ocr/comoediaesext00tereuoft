yTlie m]ultiplicity of side-speeches is the chief error in this dialogue ;
such speeches, though very common in dramatic writers, ancient and
modern, being always more or less unnatural.

› Myrtle's suspicions, grounded on the intelligence drawn from Bevil's
servant, are more artfully imagined by Sir Richard Steele, than those
of Charinus, created by employing his servant as a spy on the· actions*
of Pamphilus.

ACT II. SCENE VI.

Pamphilus is ordered in by his father: and Byrrhia, having learned all·
he wanted to know goes to acquaint· his master with it. Davus and
Simo are, therefore, left to themselves. The former plays upon the
latter with great cunning ς and whilst Simo is in doubtwhat to think, the
other artfully combats his suspicions, by which the plot is advanced.
As each distrusted the other, and it was the interest of both to disguise
their real sentiments as much as possible, this gives rise to a very
artful conversation, where the poet has succeeded ver-y happily in
making both speak agreeably to their characters

The metre is the same as in· the former scene.

1. Hic nunc, διο. [Davus in a low voice to himself, but wishing to be
heard by Simo.]—2. Ea gratia. “On that aecount.'' Gratia for

of speaking, which Perizonius on Sanc. Min. i. 13, has filled up in
this manner: Nunc quidem teque quicquam narro ac narro tum: cum
nihil narra—4. Nilne? hem! “ Nothing, say you?” Here the·
interjection hem ! denotes anger. —— 5. Praeter spem evenit. [Aside :]
‘⁸ He is disappointed in his aim, I pereeive.” Colman renders it thus z

“So, Ι perceive, you did. - [Asida] This nettles him :”

with this note : “ All the commentators and translators have understood
this whole line as spoken aside: but as the first part os it is an apt
answer to what Simo had said, and in the same style with the rest os
the conversation that Davus commonly holds with him, I rather think
