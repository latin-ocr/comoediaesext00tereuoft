the advantages the commonwealth drew from them: and it was for-
bidden to abuse them, under pain of disinheritance. Hence, in Lucian,
a young man, complaining that he had been disinherited by his father,
says, “Is there any slave-merchant who accuses me οἰ having ill-
treated him ?”-— At ita, διο. “ And yet as tenacious of 1ny word as
any man alive.'' This may apply to his ‘⁴ good faith” in the way of
business, or to his “ being as good as his word '' with regard to what
he had threatened. Reinhardt takes it in the latter sense. -- 8. Quod

still struggling with the girl, AEschinus winles, and Parmeno strikes the
procurer.]— 19. Geminabit. [To Sannio. Hereupon, Parmeno, hastily,
and without waiting for the signal from his master, gives Sannio another
blow on the face.]—20. Verum in istam partem, &a [To Parmeno :]
“But, however, you had better err in that way than the other,'' i. e.
your fault is on the right side. -21. Ι nane i'am. [Parmeno now leads
the girl into Micio’s house] ——Regnamne, &c. “ Have you usurped the
tyranny here?’' Regnum is sometimes put for tyrannis. Comp. Cic.
pro Sall. c. 7. Hic. “At Athens.’'— 22. Ornatus esses. “ You should
be recompensed according to your virtues.” Ornatas is used in a good
sense in Plaut. Capt. v. 3. 20. Comp. Cic. ad Div. v. 8.

23. Quid tibi rei mecam 'st? ‘⁴ What business have you with me ?”
Comp. Heaat. iv. 4. 20. —Nostin’ qui sim ,⁹ Sannio here, says Dona-
tus, answers very properly, for this was the common answer of a man
who owed nothing, “ Does he know me?” Not that the person to
whom he spoke did not know him, but because he had no action against
him in any court of justice. Thus, nosti me ? nosti qai sim ? are terms
drawn from the practice and formalities of the bar. Instead of saying,
“I owe you nothing,'’ the usual phrase was, “Do you know me ?’'
For a debtor was generally well known to his creditor: and AEschinus’s
answer, that he neither knew him nor desired to know him, is much
the same as if he had said, “ I do not want to have any demands upon
you.'’ Thus, the wit of this passage consists in the equivocal meaning·
of the terms, which must be lost in the translation, as our language
annexes no double sense to the words—24. Ferres infortunium. Comp.
