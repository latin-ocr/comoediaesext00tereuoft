good.” -21. Sive. Put here for quia: “Since it is a case worthy
the utmost strivings of your soul.'’ Some take sive here for vel si, as
in the Andria, i. 2.19‚ and arrange the whole sentence thus. Fac, si ι is
nunc, sive adeo digna res est, ubi tu nervos intendas tuos, ut promissa
amareant. Reinhardt says it is put for atque. Intendere nervos signi-
fies “to do one‘s utmost.’'— 22. Haud similis virgo ’st, διο. “The
girl' is by no means like our city damselsss’ —- 23. Demissis humeris, &c.

“With shoulders down, and bosoms girt, that they may seem genteelss’
Comp. Martial, xiv. 134. Ovid, Art. Am. iii. 274. —-- 24. Habitior.

“More οοτΡιιΙεῃῐ3’ —Deducunt cibum. “They stint her m her food.”
Tbey withdraw a portion of their usual meals. Comp. Cic. Off. i.
18 ς Livy, vi. 15. — 25. Tametsi bona est, διο. “ Though she be natu-
rally of a good form, they reduce her, by too much care, to a bulrush.'’
Donatus observes here, Cura mentis est ; curatio corporis ; curatura
diligentioe. For junceus Bothe reads junceam.— 26. Itaque ergo, &c.
“And so, therefore, they are loved.” Ruhnken thinks one of these
particles redundant, as in Livy, iii. 31.— Quid tua istaec? “And
what is this girl of yours?” — Nova figura oris. “ An admirable form
of countenance.'’ Nova for mira, inusitata. Comp. Adelph. iv. 7. 43
Phorm. v. 7. 79. - 27. Color verus. “ True, natural red and white.'’ -—
SolMum, &c. “ Plump and in good plight.” —- 28. Vi, clam, precario.
“ By force, by stealth, or by entreaty.'' A formula borrowed from the
civil law. See Hermann Elem. D. Μ. p. 116. Glasg. 1817.

30. Tantundem. ‘⁴ I am just as wise.” Scio must be supplied.—
31. Ne id quidem. Supply scio. “- Ι can't tell this either.’' ——32. Id
” equidem. Supply propter. —- Mecum stomachabar. “ Ι was vexed with
myself just now.'' Had not Chaerea been sdetained by Archidemides,
but followed the virgin, and seen where she. was carried, before he
met with Parmeno, the fable must have been conducted very differ-
ently from the manner in which it is now carried on. Chaerea would
not have been so well instructed in what regarded Thais, nor would
the project of his being presented to the courtezan in the Eunuch's
dress, have so readily occurred. — 33. Cui magis bonae, διο. He means
that those accidents in life, which at first had the appearance of being
fortunate, turned out the contrary to him, because he had lost sight of
the virgin. For he accounts it happiness that he had seen her, but
that was turned again into a misfortune, by meeting with Archidemides.
— 35. Quid hoc est sceleris? “ What misfortune now ?” Scelus sor
infelicitas, as in Martial, vii. 14. Thus scelesta plebs in Hor. Od. ii.
4. 17. for infelix. See Duker on Flor. i. 12. -- 40. Liquet mi dejerare.
The same as liquido dejerare possum, “ 1 can solemnly swear with a sase
conscience.’' Comp. Andr. iv. 3. 13. Dejerare for sancte juram· sor
de in composition is sometimes intensitive. So demirari for valde mirari,
Hec. v. 2. 5. See Broukh. on Propert. iv. 3. 42. —His mensibus sex,
septem, proximis. “For the last six or seven months.'' Proximis is
redundant, since its force is implied in his mensibus. See note on i.

See Lambin. on Hor. Epist. i. 1. 57.—43. Nonne hoe monstri simile ’st
‘⁴ Is there not something monstrous in this ?” So prodigio simile est

for e longinquo. — 45. Incurvas, tremulus,&c. ‘⁶ Bent, trembling‚ drop·

jawed, gasping, out of breath.'' These words agree extremely well
