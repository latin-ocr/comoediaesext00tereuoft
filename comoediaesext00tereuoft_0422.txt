dignum. Comp. Andr. i. 2. 28. Chremes, that he may the more
cunningly insinuate to Syrus his willingness that he should assist in
contriving the means to eozen Menedemus out of the money they
wanted, pretends to be angry with Clinia’s servant for his dulness and
want of contrivance. It is natural, upon this, for Syrus to ask what
he can do to prevent it; and this gives Chremes an opportunity of
opening his mind to him.—- Quem? Syrus very naturally asks this
question; for it was doubtful of whom Chremes spoke‚ whether he
meant Menedemus, or Clinia, or Dromo, or even Syrus himself. -- 20.
Syre, tibi timui male. [Syrus asidez] “ I trembled exceedingly for
you, Syrus.’' Male for valde. Comp. iv. 1. 51; Hec. iii. 2. 2. ·-— 21.

Phaedr. iv. 3. 5.-36. Si jubes. Comp. Eun. ii. 3. 98.—38. Tanto

to serve for a good defence afterwards, if he should chance to be found
out—-to endeavour to avert suspicions, lest the old man might be put
upon his guard, which would have been a great obstruction to thei:
designs. The ellipses used here too are well imagined: quo quicqum
illum senserim .- sed si quid, ne quid. The ,eountenance and action oi ι
the speaker supply what is wanting: for to gain his point the more
