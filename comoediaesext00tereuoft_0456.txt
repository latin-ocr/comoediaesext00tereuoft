amor. See note on Andr. iv. 2. 6. — Ne ille alserit. ‘⁴ Lest he have
taken cold.”— 13. Vah! quenquamne, 8ῑο. “ Good heavens! is it pos-
sible that any man should conceive in his mind, or propose to himself,
that which is dearer to him than his own existence 2 ’⁹ Some read in
animum instituere, Sco. ‘⁴ That a man should set his mind upon, or
procure any thing‚’' &a Colman renders it thus: “That a man should
dote so much, or suffer any one to wind himself so close about his
heart, as to grow dearer to him than himself ’ἰ '² In animo instituere,
“to conceive.'' Comp. Plaut. Mostel. i. 2. 2. — 14. Parare. ‘⁴ Pro-
vide‚'' “procure,’' or “ get.” Comp. Plaut. Asin. i. 3. 163 Catull.

“A quiet, tranquil life.’' Comp. Plaut. Stich. iv. 1. 26.— Otium.
“Ease.” Comp. Nepos, Pelop. c. 2; Phaedr. v. i. 7. — 18. Et, quod
fortunatum isti putant. “ And, what those of my own way of life, who
Iove ease and the town, think a happiness, Ι have never married.”
Some by isti understand those of a contrary character to Micio, who
take a wife with a large dowry, διο. Menander: 'ss μακάριόν με’,
γυναῖκα οὐ λαμβάνω. Again: *Ὅστις ’γενόμενος βούλεται ζῇν ἡδέως,
Ἑτέρων γαμούντων αὐτὸς ἀπεχέσθω γάμων.- 19. Contra hoec omnia.
The same as e contrario, “on the other hand.'’ Comp. Phorm. iii.

laborious life.'’ Comp. Andr. i. 1. 473 Plaut. Asin. i. 1. 64.-22.
Inde. For ex quibus, “ of whom.’' —23. Habui, amavi pro meo-
Habui for tractavi. “ Ι treated him and loved him as my own.” -242
In eo. For in ea re. “In doing so,’' ἰ. e. in adopting AEschinus, in
rearing him up from a child, and treating and loving him as my own.
Some by eo understand AEschinus. Colman renders it: “ Made him
my joy, and all my soul holds dear.’'

25. Ille ut item, &c. ⁴⁴ Ι strive all I can that he in turn may hold
me equally dear.’' Item for itidem, or similiter. Contra for vicissim.

Praetermitto. Supply peccata .· Ι overlook his faults.”——N0n necesse

youth are prone. So ut aetas illa fert, “as is usual at that time of
life‚” Cic. Cluent. c. 60. -— 32. Pudore, ὅτε. “ And ’tis‚ in my opinion,
better far to bind your children to you by the ties of modesty and
gentleness, than fear.’' Pudor here respects the children. We are to
inspire them with such notions as will make them ashamed of vice,
and look upon it as something mean, base, and contemptible. Libe*
ralitas regards parents, and is equivalent to “mildness,” “gentle-
ness,” or “affability‚” the true method of forming free spi-rite, born
