Aer ιν. senne 1v. 50⁷

2. 20. We are here to call to mind the character of Pamphilus, who was*
passionately fond of his wife, and who, notwithstanding the late discovery,
still found himself strongly inclined to take her back. He feels in his
breast a violent struggle betwixt love and shame. Hence his answer
to his father, so fond, passionate‚ and affecting.— 10. Sed non minuam,
&c. “But I will not alter what I first designed.’' Comp. Andr. ii.
3. 18.--Ε,τ usu quod est, id persequar. “ I will follow ‘that which is
best.'’ Comp. iv. 1. 333 Eun. v. 8. 47. Persequar for the simple
sequar. Comp. Adelph. iii. 4. 54. -— 11. Concordes magis. δ Supply

Sostrata et Philumena.
12. Nescius. “You don’t know that,” i. e. whether Sostrata and

Philumena will, or will not, be friendly with each other. — Verum tua
refert nihil. “But it is of no importance to you, whether they be
friendly or not.” Comp. Eun. ii. 3. 29. Could we prove mea here to
be a dissyllable, and not a contr-action by synaeresis, it would be an
important point gained with regard to syntax. See note on Phorm. iv.
5. 11. Grammarians are in doubt whether mea, tua, sua, &c. after
refert and interest, be ablatives feminine, or accusatives neuter plural.
Ῑ once thought that, joined with refert, they were nominatives femi-
nine, and accusatives neuter when construed with interest ; that is, mea
refert being the same as mea res fert, and mea interest equivalent to est
inter mea negotia, or interest ad mea negotia ‚· for in Cicero we find ad
nostram laudem interest, “it is important with regard to.'’ We find
however in Plautus, mea refert gratia ‚· and in the Phormio, v. 7. 47, if
the reading be correct,

Etiam dotatis aoleo. Cn. Quid id nostra 2 Pn. Nihil.

But here in some editions the reading is,
Quid istud nostra ἲ ΡΗ. Nil.

-— 13. Quando haec aberit. ‘⁴ When Sostrata is gone into the country.”
—Haec aetas, διο. Supply senilis. ‘⁴ We old folks are odious to the young.’ ⁰
Comp. Heaut. iii. 3. 41.

14. E medio. ‘⁴ From amongst you.” This I conceive to be the
author’s meaning. Donatus doubts whether he meant e vita or ex
urbe. -- Nos jam fabula sumus. “ We are now become a loy-word, The
old man and the old woman.'’ Donatus imagines this to allude to the
ancient manner of writing in rables, which very often began in these
words, ’γέρων καὶ γραῦς, senex atque anus. Thus in Plautus we meet
with one who begins a story in these words: Fuit olim, quasi ego sum,
senex. See Muretus', Var. Lect. xviii. 18, p. 468. Schirach (θίαν.
·Poet. Class. under the word fabula,) interprets it thus: “ We have now
become, in consequence of our age, the scorn and jest of every one.”
Ruhnken z “ We are held in scorn and contempt.’' The ancients, he
adds, called every thing they despised, persons as well as things, sabulae
and nugae. — 16. Per tempas. Comp. Andr. iv. 4. 44. — Accedamus.
