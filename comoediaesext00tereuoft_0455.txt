Furius Publius, a great politician; and in negotio to Laelius, one of
the wisest men of the republic. In otio the same as in pace. Comp.

“And who in peace and in war, and also in your private concerns,
have rendered to the republic in general, and to every one in par-
ticular, the most considerable services, without becoming on that
account the more haughty or overbearing.’' Eugraphius says, Quorum

ACT 1. ScENss Ι.

Micio, coming out of his house early in the morning, calls Storax,
one of the servants who had been sent the night before to wait upon
AEschinus home 3 and finding that no person answered him, he hence
infers that neither master nor servants have yet returned. He dis·
covers a great deal of solicitude for his adopted son AEscffinus, on

- account of his absence: and descants on the manner of training up

children, and considers gentleness of more service than harshness and
severity.

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics‚ which is the case with
the opening scene of all Terence's comedies.

1. ScoraxI—Non rediit, διο. “ Ho Storax l—No reply! Then
AEschinus, it seems, did not return last night from supper.'’ Some
read this verse with a note of interrogation. —- 2. Qui advorsum ierant.
“ Who went to meet and conduct him home.” Adversum ire signifies
not only “to go and meet,” but also “to go for a person at an
appointed time.'' Servants to whom was assigned the office of going
at a certain bour for their masters, and conducting them home in
safety, were called adversitores. See this word in Gesner’s Thes. Lat.
.— The first syllable in ierant is made long, as if it had been iverant.»-

has cum animo sao cogitare. The usual phrase is secum cogitare, as in
Eun. i. 1. 19.—6. Parentes propitii. “Loving parents.'' Propitius

, is also applied to mortals in Cic. Att. viii. 16. It is an epithet be-

longing properly to the gods.— 8. {grimo obsequi. “ That you indulge
