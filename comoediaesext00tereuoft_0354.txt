ACT III. SCENE Ι.

In this scene we have a lively representation of the manner which
the parasites and flatterers of those times took to ingratiate themselves
with men of great fon-tunes and shallow understandings. As men of
the least merit are most apt to be overrun with vanity‚ and fond of
being thought to possess those talents which they want, so they are
easily made the dupes of those who know how to apply to their weak
side. Gnatho had carried the young virgin as a present from the
captain to Thais. Thraso and the parasite are here introduced, as now
first meeting after the delivery of the present. Thraso asks how it had
been received3 and Gnatho answers in the manner which he thought
would be most agreeable to this conceited fool, by puffing up his·
ridiculous vanity. This gives the captain an opportunity of expa-
tiating, and talking magnificently of himself ; to all which the parasite
counterfeits a ready belief, and hears him with an air of seeming
admiration.
