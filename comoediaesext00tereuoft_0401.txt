*Comp. Ean. i. 2. 54.—93. AEdes mercede. “A house to be let.''
Some incorrectly translate this: “ A house to be sold.” See Bentley's
note, and Cuper. Obss. i. 17. It appears by this, that the Greeks and
Romans used to fix bills on their doors, as we do. So cedes locandae,
v“a house to be let.'' Comp. Plaut. Trin. i. 2. 1313 Cic. Epist. ad
Aet. iv. 23 ad Dz‘v. vii. 29. —— Quasi talenta ad quindecim coegi. “ In all
Ι got together about fifteen talents.” F ifteen Attio talents are equal
to 32906. ὗε. of our money. See note on Andr. v. 4. 48. Quasi added
to numerals has the signification of sere, or circiter. Co'e'gi for collegi.

95. Decrevi. For putavi, judicavi, or existimavi. So Cic. Epist. ad
Dia. ii. 6; ad Aa. iii. 15. See Perizon. on Sanct. Min. iv. 15. — 98.
Meus particeps. “ To partake it with me.'' Calpurnius says particeps
here is put for haeres ,· Ruhnken says it is used for-filius, because a son,
during his father’s life, had participation in his father’s property. See
Cic. Verr. i. 44«. There is much resemblance between this character
of Menedemus, and that of Laertes in the Odyssey. Laertes, un-

hagpy and afflicted at the absence of his son, is under the same trouble
an anxlety:

“ Thy sire in solitude foments his care:
Thy court is joyless, for thou art not there.”-Pope’e odyss. xi. 226.

“ Laertes lives, the miserable sire,
Lives, but implores of every pow’r to lay
The burden down, and wishes for the day.

Torn from his offspring in the eve of life,” &ce-Odys& xv. 375.

“ But old Laertes weeps his life away,
And deems thee lost—
The mournsul honr, that tore his son away,
sent the sad sire in solitude to stray:
Yet busied with his slaves, to ease his woe,

He drest the vine, and bade the {arden bloW.”—Odyss. xvi. 145.
