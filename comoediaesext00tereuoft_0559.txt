Pro‘r or rins: Pnommo.

Chremes and Demipho were brothers, both Athenians. Chremes
married at Athens Nausistrata, a woman with a large fortune, and by
κ her had a son named Phaedria. Nausistrata, besides her other wealth,
had large possessions in Lemnos. Thither Chremes went yearly to
collect his rents. While he was stopping there, he fell in love with
a poor girl, whom he likewise married, and had a daughter by her,
called Phanium. To prevent these circumstances from becoming.
public, he changed his name, and passed at Lemnos under that of
Stilpho, The revenues of his Athenian wife’s possessions in Lemnos
furnished enough to support his new wife there together with her
daughter z and at his return home, he excused himself under different
pretences3 ill health, the lowness of markets‚ and such like. Demipho,
his brother, had a son named Antipho, and as Phanium had now ar-
rived at her fifteenth year, the brothers agreed between themselves,
that Chremes should bring his Lesbian wife and daughter privately to
Athens; and that Demipho should marry his son Antipho to Phanium.
For this purpose, Chremes goes to Lemnos; and it happened at the
same time, that Demipho was under the necessity of undertaking a
journey to Cilicia. At their departure, they leave the care of their
sons to Geta, one of Demipho's servants.- No sooner are the old men
gone, than Phaedria falls in love with a music-girl: but there was this
unlucky circumstance in it, that he had nothing wherewith to purchase
her from the person to whom she belonged. Meantime the Lemnian
wife, urged by poverty, and no longer able to wait for the arrival of
her husband, who had been away from her beyond the ordinary time,
embarks for Athens, together with her daughter and the nurse. There
they inquire for Stilpho, but in vain3 no person of that name is to
be found at Athens. This misfortune affected the mother so deeply,
that she died soon after; and Antipho chancing to see Phanium, who,
with the nurse, was paying the last office to the deceased, falls despe-
rately in love with her. He comes next day to the nurse, begging
that she will resign her to him, but is rejected, unless he will consent
to marry her. He would gladly do any thing, but dreads his absent
father3 till at last Phormio, a parasite, gives him the following counsel.
There was a law among the Athenians, in favour of orphans, obliging
those who were next akin to them, either tomarry them, or give them a
portion. Ι, says the parasite, will pretend to have been the friend of this
young woman's father; that, therefore, I undertake her cause, bring
an action against you as her nearest relation, and insist that you marry
her according to the terms of the law. Yon, on the contrary, must
manage so as to give me an easy victory, and have yourself cast. By this
means you will obtain what you so much desire; and, when your father
returns, have a good excuse ready.—Every thing is conducted as the
parasite had advised. The marriage is concluded, and soon after the
old men arrive, both on the same day; and are extremely disconcerted
by the news, the one that his son had married a wife without a fortune,
the other, lest by losing this opportunity of marrying his daughter, the
whole story of his amour might come to be divulged. At the same
time, the owner of the music-girl, whom Phaedria was in love with,
threatens that he will sell her to another, unless they immediately pay
him thirty minae for her. To obtain this, Geta frames the following
