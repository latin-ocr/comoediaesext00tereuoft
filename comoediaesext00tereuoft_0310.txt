27 2 Annam,

Dacier contends that quo is an ablative, with which id is understood.-

Ruhnken considers quo as put for propter quod, or quare. — 33. 11ae ’
nuptiae. Donatus and Bentley read lzaec nuptiae ,· for the ancients used· z

kaec for hae in the nominative plural. — 35. Scio : tu coactus, &c. “ I
know it: you are constrained, poor man, by inclination.'’ — Mane.
“ Nay, but have patience !'’' Mane is used by a person frequently
interrupted, and who cannot obtain a fair hearing. Comp. Heaut. ii.

3. 32. — 37. Cur me enicas ,⁹ “ Why rack me thus Τ nay, hear me Ρ* ’

40. Interturbat. “Davus is the cause of this confusion.” —41.
Nisi. This, says Ruhnken, is often put for sed, especially aster nescio.
It is rather put for nisi quod in this passage, which is fully expressed
Heaut. v. 2. 6; Ovid, Epist. xviii. 11, and Met. XV. 7845 but· quod is
generally omitted. Comp. Eun. iv. 5. 93 Plzorm. v. 7. 60.·-Μί1ιί

, Deos fuisse iratos. “ The» gods meant in their anger 1 shmfld'listen to

l him.” He means by t'his that he had lost his senseS. The ancients
supposed, that when any person was deprived of his reason, he had·
given the gods some cause for resentment. Comp. Phorm. iv. 3. 315.
— 43. At tibi Di. The incipient particle at has great force in bursts
of indignation and anger. Thus, At te Di perdant, Eun. iii. 1. 41 ;
Virg. AEn. xi. 535. At· tibi pro scelere, δῖε. Hor. Epod. v. 1. At 0-
Deorum quicquid, &c- Com-p. Ovid, Epist. xii. 1. — Duint. For dent.

44. Dic mihi. These words, according· to Ruhnken, are always
uttered either in pride or anger. -452 Quod, m' hoc. ⁰‘·W}1atmore·
effectus} counsel could they give than this of yours, Davus 2⁹⁹ — 462
Scio. [Ironically.] “ I knOW.” — 48. Nisi si id putas, δῖε. “ Unless
you think, becausevthe business has gone ill at first, we cannot grast
advantage on misfortune.’' Menander, as cited by Stobaeus, ’Ὥστε

μηδεὶς, πρὸς Θεῶν, Πράττων κακῶς λίαν ἀθυμήσῃ πστέ. Ἴσως ’γὰρ ἀγαθοῐῖι

τοῦτο πρόφασις γίνεται. - Processit parum. “Has not succeededlf
— 50. Immo, etiam. [Ironz'cally.]' “ Oh yes, Ι warrant you.” —Satz‘s
credo. ‘⁶1 am> fully peruaded.'’ Satis, saysRuhnken, is elegantIy
joined with> credo. Comp. Eun. v. 8. 21. — Si advigilaveris. ‘A‘ If you
look well to it.” Comp. Pllorm. i. 4. 26. —51. Ex unis geminas.
[Sarcastically] — 53. Manibus, pedibus. See note i: 1. 134.—55.·
Tuum. A monosyllable here. - Si quid praeter spem evenit. ‘⁸ If any
thing happen contrary to our expectation.” -— 5'6. Parum succedit quod
ago. It is our part to try and endeavour, but the event is not always in
our power. Davus had reason to think he was ill-used by Pamphilus,
who continued to chide him so much for an accident· that had. fallen
out contrary to his intention. —-57.. Me missumsace. “ Dismiss me.”
Comp. Hec. v. 2. 14.

58. Cupio. Supply te missumsacere. — Restitue, &e- Su ply modo:
⁵ “ Provided you restore me to the condition in which you ound mess'?
Restituere locum, according to Burmann and Ruhnken, is a· military
f phrase, signifying ‘⁴ to restore one to his former rank-’³ —- 59.. At jam
hoc opus est. “ But do it instantly.’' — Hem l· sed mane, διο. “ Histz
hold awhile z Ι hear the creaking of Glycerium’s door;'' A Glycerio
for Glycerii. See note iii. 1. 3. We learn from Plutarch, in Publicola,
that when any one was coming out of a house he struck the door on
the inside, that such as were without might be warned to take care,
lest they might be hurt. The doors of the Romans, on the contrary,
opened inside, as appears from Plin. xxxvi. 15. But the creaking
meant here is more probably of the door itself upon the hinges. -— 60.
