had been made to any particular passage in his works. But though
Scaliger was ever dogmatical and positive in his opinion, yet that opinion
was not always incontrovertible. In the present instance Ι am so far
from assenting to Madame Dacier, that the⁸ fact is ⁴ beyond all doubt,'
that I will venture to say there is not the least ground for such an asser-
tion. Donatus, who mentions this play in his preface to the Phormio,
does not afford the least colour to such an argument3 nor do Ι believe
there is any more countenance given to it by the scholiasts on Aristo-
phanes: whose comedies it would be an extremely difficult task to
reconcile to an agreement with the zmitz‘es.

‘⁶ One of the chief points in dispute between Hedelin and Menage‚
about this comedy, relates to this interval ; and great part of the con-
troversy turns upon a very obscure and uncertain part of literature,
viz. whether the Athenian month Anthesterion be agreeable to our
April, or J anuary. Both agree that a night elapses between the second
and third act; but Hedelin, who is followed by Madame Dacier in the
above note, contendS, that according to the time of the year, and cir-
cmnstance of the piece, it is an interval of six or seven hours, which
Menage extends to thirteen or fourteen. Each of them lays out a deal
of learning on this question, but in my mind to very little purpose. It
is agreed on all hands, that a whole night certainly passes; and the
spectator has not time to enter into a minute disquisition, whether 'tis
in June or December; nor indeed could any thing so directly tend to
make the observation of the unities appear ridiculous, as such a trifling
consideration—As to what Madame Dacier says of this interval’s being
interwoven with the subject, and of the supposed employments of the
characters, in their absence from the stage, being made conducive to
the fable, it is perfectly just3 and every skilful play-wright should con-
trive his intervals with the like art. But to fill up these chasms by
occupying the audience also in the same manner, is, I think, a more
curious device than any in the Rehearsal. Madame Dacier herself
could not be insensible of the difficulty, and confesses that a play of
Moliere‚ so divided in the representation, would appear very ridiculous3
yet is willing to imagine that even a modern drama might be thus ex-
hibited with propriety. Let us suppose, therefore, that, at the first
opening of the theatre in the Haymarket, Sir John Vanburgh had written
a comedy, in which he had introduced a masquerade at the end of the
second act. The spectators assemble—two acts are played—then comes
the masquerade3 and the spectators, in order to fill up the interval,
slip on their dominos, game, drink‚ dance, and intrigue till day-light.
With what appetite would they return to the representation of the last
three acts? However such a partition might be received at Rome or
Athens, I think it would never go down at Paris or London: and, were
it not for the example of Madame Dacier, I should imagine that even
the most rigid French critic would think it more reasonable to be
wafted from shore to shore by Shakespeare's Chorus, than to adopt this
extraordinary method of preserving the unities.”—Conms.
