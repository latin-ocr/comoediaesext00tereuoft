Atticam esse hanc. This is artfully said to terrify Chremes, and make
him break off the match: for among the laws of the Athenians was
fixis equitable one, which compelled the man to marry her whom he
had seduced, if she were free-born. 'H' βιασθεῖσα, ἢ γάμον, ἦ θάνατον

48. Hic est ille, διο. [Addressing Mysis] “This is Chremes him-
self. Think not 'twas Davus you imposed upon.” Hic ille est, says
Ruhnken, is an elegant formula3 citing Livy, ii. 2; xxvi. 17; Cic. de

sudden appearance of Chremes, when he altered his plans.—55. Paulum
interesse, &c. “Is there then no difference, think you, whether· all
you say falls naturally from the heart, or comes from dull premedita-
tion 2” In sactthedifference is infinite; and Davus, however-*he might
have frightened Mysis a little, yet acted with.the greatest prudence
with respect to the main chance. For what one says naturally and un-
premeditated, has by far a greater air and appearance of truth than
what is said after being beforehand prepared for it.
