possible. Syrus extols his wisdom, and pretends to admire him greatly,
hut manifestly sneers all the while. Demea seems not to have any sus-
picion, but that he is serious: for men of his character are apt to put
a great value upon themselves, and implicitly swallow every kind of
praise‚ because they think they deserve it. The poet gives an instance
of this weakness, in the passage now referred to. Demea imagines
himself a man of too great quickness and penetration to be deceived.
It were impossible for his son to make a false step, but he would dis-
cover it immediately; nay, could discern the very first inclinations and
propensities to go astray. This must be highly entertaining to the
reader, who knows the while that Ctesipho is chiefly in fault, and this
very wise father is the dupe of the whole family. —43. Offecissem. For

46. Quid eum? [Demea with an affected carelessness .·] “ But what

[Syrus asido, turning to the spectators :] “ I will drive the old fellow into
the countryss’ Abigere is properly said of driving cattle. Syrus uses
the word comically instead of mittam. —— 49. Haereret. ‘⁶ A metaphor-

Intervenit homo, διο. “ Up comes my gentleman, all of a sudden upon

Ctesipho resembled him, takes care to omit no circumstance that he
thought would be pleasing to the old man. -54. Haeccine flagitia. In
case of an infinitive with an accusative used interrogatively, we may
supply credibile est, or possibile est.—- 55. Oh! lacrymo gaudio.¹ We
here see that Demea is prone to believe every thing to the advantage of
his favourite son.—— 56. Argentum perdis. Comp. Heaut. iii. 1. 65. -

iii. 8. 14. Donatus seems to doubt, says Patrick‚ whether speculum
comes in· properly here, where the poet speaks of examining into the
lives of other men, to ascertain the proper standard for our own con-
duct. 1 think it enough, he adds, to observe‚ that as we make use of a
glass to correct those faults and blemishes which custom or negligence
may have given us, and to find out the air, dress, and manner that best
becomes us: in like manner, we ought to look into the lives of others,
