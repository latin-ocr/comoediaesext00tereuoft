very different disposition from that in which he was the last time they
met. He has now discovered his daughter’s situation ; and, instead vof
thinking Pamphilus in fault, lays all the blame upon his wife. Laches
again is overjoyed to hear he has got a grandson, and urges his son
more than ever to take back his wife. But this, instead of being any
weight, is now an argument against it. For however he might have
been prevailed on to overlook what had happened to Philumena, so
long as it might be kept secret, yet he could by no means resolve to
submit to the meanness of bringing up another man’s child. His
obstinacy provokes his father, who, not knowing the true reason of it,
and imagining it was owing to his old passion for Bacchis, falls upon
him with severe and bitter reproaches, till at length Pamphilus, not
knowing how to defend himself, withdraws. Upon this the old men
consult between themselves what is best to be done3 and, persuaded
that they have hit upon the true reason of his aversion to Philumena,
resolve to send for Bacchis, and by promises or threats to prevail on
her not to entertain Pamphilus, nor to receive his visits.

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.

1. Tibi quoqne, διο. We have seen before how much Phidippus was
provoked with his wife. Here he is seen coming out and talking
with Philumena, who is within. He professes himself displeased
with her too, though he owns her fault was less, and admitted of
some excuse from her mother's instigations. -—- 2. Graviter. For
vehementer. -— Factum turpiter. Donatus supplies quod abscesseris
domo mariti. — 3. Etsi tibi causa est. ‘⁴ Though you have some excuse
for this affair.” Comp. Phorm. ii. l. 4, 7. De hac re for quod attinet
hanc rem. ——4. Huic vero nulla est. ‘⁴ But for your mother there is 110
excuse.'’ -5. In ipso tempore. Comp. Andr. v. 6. 10. -6. Quid re-
spondebo his ? [Pamphilus asides] ‘⁴ How shall I excuse myself to
these 2 '’ Comp. Heaut. iii. 3. 49. —Aut quo pacto hoc operiam P · “ Or
how shall I conceal this secret ’ἒ ” The common reading was aperiam ,-
which Colman translates, “ How shall I explain? '' with this note:
Bentley and Madame Dacier, (he might have added Rivius‚) convert
this 'to operiam, “ How shall I hide it?” I see no occasionfor the
alteration. Pamphilus did not mean to divulge the secret ς but in his
present embarrassment he might easily be perplexed how to assign
plausible reasons for his way of acting.

the case, that you are otherwise inclined, however, take the child.”
According to the law of the Atheniens, the male child always followed
the father. —16. Sensit peperisse. [Pamphilus aside .·] “ He knows
of her delivery. Confusion !'’ Pamphilus foresaw the consequence of
the discovery that Phidippus had made. He must either disclose the
secret he had so faithfully promised to conceal, or submit to the
redoubled importunity of his father, to take back his wife, and bear a
