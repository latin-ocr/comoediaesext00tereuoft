⁴‘ See what would be the result of these antitheses! I call them anti-
theses ; for the contrast of character is, in the plan of the drama, what
that figure is in conversation. It is happy3 but it must be used with
moderation ; and in the elevated style totally excluded.

“ What is the most common state of society—that where characters
are contrasted, or where they are wholly different?

“What is the intention of contrast in character ’.Ρ Doubtless to ren-
der one of the two more striking ; but that effect can only be obtained
where they both appear together. What a monotony will this create in
the dialogue! What a constraint will it impose on the conduct of the
sable! How can I attend to the natural chain of events, and proper
succession of scenes‚ if I arn engaged by the necessity of always bring·
ing the two opposite characters together? How osten will it happen,
ξὶιέἶ the (hontraSt will require one scene, and the true course of the

'a e anot er !

“ Besides, if the two contrasted characters are both drawn with equal
force, the intention of the drama will be rendered equivocal. To con-
ceive the whole force of this reasoning, open the Adehihi of Terence.
There you will see two brothers contrasted, both drawn with equal force3
and you may challenge the most subtle critic to tell you which is the
principa] character, Micio or Demea. If he venture to pronounce
before the last scene, he will find to his astonishment, that he whom
he has taken, during five acts, for a man of sense, is a fool ; and that he
whom he has taken for a fool, may be a very sensible man. ’

“ One would suppose at the beginning of the fifth act, that the author,
embarrassed by the contrast which he had established, was obliged to
abandon this design, and to turn the interest of his play topsy-turvy.
But what is the consequence? That we no longer know which side to
take ; and after having been all along for Micio, and against Demeffiwe
conclude without knowing whether we are for one or the other. One
would almost desire a third father to preserve the golden mean between

ἴδε two characters, and to point out the faults of each of them.'’—

EXCURSUS VIII.

“It has been said that L’Ecole des Maris, (“The School for Hus-
bands‚'') was a copy of the Adelphi of Terence: if so, Moliere deserves
more praise for having brought the taste of ancient Rome into France,
than reproach for having stolen his play. But the Adelphi furnished
nothing more than the bare idea of L'Ecole des Maris. There are in
the Adelphz' two old men of opposite humours‚ who give, each of them,
a different education to the children they educate3 and there are, in
like manner, in L’Ecole des Maris, two guardians, of which one is
severe, and the other indulgent: there lies the whole resemblance.
There is scarcely any intrigue in the Adelphi,· that of L’Ecole des
Maris is delicate, interesting, and comic. One of the women in Terence's
piece, who ought to be the principa] character, is never seen, or heard,
except at her accouchement. The Isabelle of Moliere is almost for
ever on the stage, full of grace and spirit; and sometimes mingles a
decency‚ even in the tricks which she plays her guardian. There is no
