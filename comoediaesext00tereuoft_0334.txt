the piece had been wholly his own. — 25. Colacem. Κόλακα, “ The ³

Cocaae‚” or “the Parasite.'’ Bentley observes that the Colax of ³
N aevius is nowhere mentioned, but the Colax of Plautus is cited by ’

N onius Marcellus. Naevius was before Plautus, and therefore could

not write in conjunction with him. BesideS, if Terence borrowed the -
characters of the Parasite and the Captain from Plautus and' Naevius, ³
Plautus must have borrowed from Nae-vius, so that the accusation wilt j

also carry an apology along with it. He therefore· proposes to correct ‘⁷‘
the passage thus : ¹

Colacem esse nempe Plauti veterem fabulam.

But Bothe reads Naevi aut Plauti. The Miles Gloriosus of Plautus was»¹

not taken from the Colax of Menander, but from another Greek· play ἵ·
called Ἀλαζών, “ the Boaster :'’ and the Parasite of Plautus is but a
trifling character, never appearing after the first scene. ——- 27. Impru- .

Terence should be ignorant of these two plays, written by Naevius and ;
Plautus : but our wonder w‘rll abate, when we reflect that all the ,
learning of the time was confined to MSS„ which being few and not* ’
common, could not be in the hands of many. Besides, as it was not' .
then so general a custom to collect in one volume· all the works of the-
