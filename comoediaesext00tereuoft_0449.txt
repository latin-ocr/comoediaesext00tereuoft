“In your mother's presence.” Both Greeks and Romans behaved
with so much respect towards their females, that they never suffered an
unbeooming word to escape them in their presence. Both religion and

polity required that they should always, before them, show the strictest l

ACT V. Seram-2 V.

In this scene we have the play concluded, to the mutual satisfaction
of all the several persons concerned in it. Menedemus interposes as
a mediator between the father and son; Clitipho himself, too, shows
so much concern for what is past, that Chremes is at length sostened,
and agrees to pardon him, upon condition that he will have done with
the follies of youth, and marry : to which at last, with some difficulty,
he is brought to consent.

ΑΗ the verses of this scene are Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic,
except vs. 6, which is Tetrameter Iambio Acatalectic.

answered by this speech of Chremes. First‚ at the conclusion of the
play, the marriage of his daughter is promoted‚ and here represented
as agreed upon and settled3 and Clitipho, who is already ashamed of
himself, is excited to beg to be restored to his father's favour, which
he obtains upon condition of changing his manner of life. — 4. ,
