Comp. Eun. iii. 2. 53. [Exeunt Phidippus, Bacchis, and the waiting

about the discovery by means of Bacchis going into the family, gave
Sir Richard Steele the hint of sending Sealand to Indiana‘s lodgings
for the same purpose. When we are professedly imitating one part of
an author, we naturally enough make use-of other passages in his
works; and what inclines me the more to this conjecture, is, that
Steele makes exactly the same use of the bracelet that Terence does
of the ring, though the presence of Isabella did not render it so neces·
sary. Such an inconsistency might very possibly proceed from
imltation.

but it is but justice to observe of this act in general, that the per·

tending to the catastrophe are well contrived and most naturally intro-
duced. — [Exit Laches.]

ACT V. Scene III.

Parmeno· had been despatched to the Acropolis on a pretended
errand, (iii. 4. 17.) Here he is seen returning and complaining of
his master, for having sent him in quest of a man that was not to be
found. Bacchis in the mean time had been with Myrrhina and Philu-
mena, and by an accident, that will appear in the sequel, had found
that Pamphilus was the father of the child. Ovexjoyed at so important
a discovery, she hastens out, and seeing Parmeno, despatches him to
§famPhflUffi to bring him to her immediately, that she may inform him

the ood news.

The giirst seventeen verses of this scene are Tetrameter Trochaics
