Comp. Eun. iv. 7. 36. Patrick observes here, that, if one were to
argue from propriety, as Geta had before said places, the words illud
durum come best from Phaedria, as a kind of antithesis to the former:
and then ego expediam serves Geta by way of reply, and at the same
time very happily describes the vanity of those slaves, who are apt to
fancy every thing within the reach of their cunning. —- Ego expediam.

‘- with the Stoics. Ι cannot help thinking, says Colman, that the intro—

duction of it in this place has commonly been considered too seriously3
and Ι have scarce any doubt, but that Terence intended it as a stroke
of character. Commentators, in general, are never so happy as when
they light upon a sentence in a classic author, which they can extol as
a lesson of sound morality. But in dramatic writings we are not
merely to confine ourselves to the consideration of what is said, but
who says it. Donatus, in his preface to this play, says that it is
founded on passions almost too high for comedy3 but that the poet
contrives to temper every circumstance by his art. In tlie present
instance, the old gentleman is indeed in. a violent passiam but his anger
is so managed throughout the scene, that it becomes truly comic t and
Donatus refers us to a similar passage in the Adelpm‘, iii. 3. 61, &c-
where Demea in like manner delivers moral precepts, which are turned
to ridicule and archly parodied by the impudent slave. — 16. Deputare
