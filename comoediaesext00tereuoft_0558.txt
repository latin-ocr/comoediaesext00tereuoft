NOTES ON THE PHORMIO.

Pflommo. This comedy takes its name from the parasite, who is
the chief engine in the plot. The original play, from which Terence
translated it, was called Ἐπιδικαζομένη. See Prol. vs. 25.

INscmPrmN.

, Lums Romms. The “ Roman Games,'' otherwise called Ludi
'³ Circenses, were celebrated on the fourth of September, in honour of
’ the great gods, Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. See Burgess's Descrip-
ticm qs the Circus. — T1131rs IMPARIBUS. For a Lydian and a Tyrian,

Prol. vs. 25. - FACTA 1-:s'r 1v. Donatus explains this, edita quarto
loco, that it was acted the fourth of Terence’s comedies. Madame
Dacier denies this. She reads facta quarto, translating it, Elle fiat
representee quatre sois. The words quarto and quartum have afforded
matter of much dispute. When Pompey was just about to consecrate
the temple of Victory, a difficulty arose how he should express his

third consulship3 whether it ought to be consul tertio, or consul tertium. Δ

The learned men of Rome were divided in their opinions about it; and
even Cicero left the question undecided: for in order to satisfy all
parties, he directed it should be thus abbreviated, consul tert. —- Facta
quarto here can mean nothing else, but that the Phemio was acted
four times in one year, to distinguish its merit; and not, as Donatus
interprets, that it was Terence’ s fourth play' 1n order of composition.
So far Madame Dacier. Acta quartum is, perhaps, the true reading.
