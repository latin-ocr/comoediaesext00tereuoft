PREFACE.

THE Edition of Terence now submitted to the classical
student was undertaken at the request of the Bookseller3
and has been executed, as nearly as possible, on the plan
of Anthon‘s Horace, which has justly obtained the sanc—
tion of several of the most eminent scholars of the present
day. f On this plan the compiler of the following sheets
flatters himself that he has made considerable improve-
ment, by not being content with giving the mere trans-
lation or meaning of certain phrases and idioms‚ but by
invariably explaining the grammatical construction of
such phrases, when deemed necessary, elucidating them
by reference to other authors, and by a continual com-
parison of similar passages of Terence, thus making our
author his own interpreter.

The Notes are in a great measure selected, translated,
or abridged from the most approved commentators, both
ancient and modern 3—from Donatus, Eugraphius, Cal-
purnius, Fae'rni, Boecler', Guyet, Farnaby, Madame Da-
cier, Bentley, Westerhoove, Patrick, Colman, Le Monnier,
Zeune, Schmieder, Perlet, Reinhardt, &c And, besides
containing much original and useful matter, the entire of
Ruhnken’s valuable AnnotationS, called his Dic-tata, has
been translated and incorporated in a compressed form.

Many passages from the lost plays of Menander
and Apollodorus, found dispersed in the scholia, and
other writings of the ancients‚ and corresponding with, or
seeming to be the original of similar passages in. Terence,
are inserted in these Notes, each in its proper place. A
few critical disquisitions, chiefly from Colman, (whose
stores, as well as those of Patrick‚ have been unsparingly
laid under contribution,)and these appertaining to comedy,
or discussing the merits of Terence as a dramatist, but
too· lengthy to be inserted in the Notes, are added at the
end of the work by way of Excursuses.
