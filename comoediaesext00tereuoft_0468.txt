ACT ΙΙ. ΞΟΕΝΕ ΙΙΙ.

The abduction of the music-girl was not on account of AEschinus
himself, but for his brother. Endeavours had been used to obtain her
fairly from Sanni03 but he insisted upon conditions which it wan
impossible for them to comply with. This reduced Ctesipho to the
greatest despair, insomuch that he was on the point of leaving his
country. AEscfflnus, seeing the consequences were likely to prove so
terrible, resolves upon violence, and, as we have seen, carries the
girl off by force. Ctesipho had by this time heard of it, and is here
introduced full of joy at his good fortune, and of gratitude to a brother
who had done so much for him.

This scene consists of Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic.

2. Verum enimvero. Cicero scarcely ever uses these partiales in this
manner3 they are frequently so used by Livy and Sallust, and par-
ticularly by the latter. Comp. Cat. c. 2. — Id demu‘m juvat. “ That
in fine is delightful.” Demum is used in the same sense by Sallust,

7. O Ctesipho. Nothing can be better conducted than this meeting
of Ctesipho and Syrus. The latter sees Ctesipho happy, and possessed
of all his wishes. Ctesipho is addressed unexpectedly by Syrus, and
turns to him with an emotion of surprise, Ο Syre ,Ι but as his thoughts
are full of AEschinus, the very first question regards him, AEschinus
