while to remark here the art and address of the poet, who makes Pam-
philus express himself in terms so full of affection sor his wife, at the
very time he is going to be a witness of the thing most shocking to a
husband. This makes the contrast still greater, and gives us a higher
idea of the distress into which Pamphilus must be plunged. [Exit

ACT III. ScENE ΙΙ.

While Pamphilus is gone in to Philumena, his mother Sostrata, who
had likewise overheard the noise, is hastening to know the cause of
it. Parmeno recalls her, and acquaints her of her son's arrival, from
whom she will soon learn all she wishes to know. Pamphilus soon
appears, but with a sorrowful and dejected air. He dissembles, how-
ever, his real grief, and contrives to remove both Parmeno and his
mother, that he may be at liberty to vent his sorrow, and by repeating
to himself this new and unexpected scene of woe‚ let the audienee
into the secret of the condition in which he had found his wife.

This scene consists of Tetrameter Iambics Catalectic.
