ACT ΙΙΙ. Soram: V.

Chaerea, we have seen, had been presented to Thais in place of the
Eunuch3 and the project had succeeded. He therefore comes out
from the house of Thais triumphing in his good fortune, and uttering his
joy in very extravagant terms. Antipho, at some distance, overhears
him3 and, impatient to know what the matter was, goes up to
him and inquires. Chaerea, no less desirous to communicate the
success of his scheme, describes all the steps of this adventure with
wonderful vivacity.

Of this scene, verses 1 and 2 are Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic ς
10 and 11, Tetrameter Trochaics Acatalectic3 5—8, 14—43, are
Tetrameter Iambics Acatalecti03 3, 9, 12, 13, 44—66, Tetrameter
Iambics Catalectic.

1. Numquis hic est ‚⁹ [Enter Chaerea in the Eunuch's habit, and
looking about.] Comp. iii. 3. Pla—Hinc. From the house of Thais, which
he had just left.-——N emo homo’st. Homo here is redundant, as inthe Adelphi,
ii. 3. 6. Comp. Cic. ad Div. xv. 10. — 2. Jamne erumpere hoc licet mihi
gaudium ,⁹ “May Ι now pour forth my excessive joy?’' Erumpere
is used in an active sense also in Virg. Georg. i. 445 3 AEn. xi. 377;
Cic. Act. xvi. 3. -— 3. N unc· est profecto. Supply tempus, which Madame
Dacier improperly inserts in the text. It is osten omitted, as in Livy,
vii. 32; Comp. Petron. c. 127 ; Sanct. Min. iv. 4. The following lines
from Shakespeare contain exactly the same sentiment as this of Terence :

‘⁶ If I were now to die,
'Twere now to be most happy3 for, I sear,
My soul hath her content so absolute,
That not another comfort, like to this,

succeeds in unknown fate.''
Othello. Act 11. Sc. 1.

4. Ne hoc gaudium, Sco. “ Lest life blast my present joy by some
disaster.'’ See Andr. Prol. 16. —5. Sed neminemne curiosum, &c-
Supply videam. Some MSS. have intervenire video. But the indica-
tive may be omitted, as in the Andria, iv. 2. 6. ‘⁴ But shall I see no
curious impertinent come across me now, and deafen and murder me
with questions ?” Comp. Plaut. Stich. ii. 1. 44. All this is extremely
natural. In great emotions of joy we are not only apt to express our·
selves in terms somewhat extravagant, but to wish for the company of
some friend, to whom we may impart what we feel. — 6. Quoquo eam.
‘⁶ VVhithersoever Ι go.’'—- Obtundat. Supply aures meas. Comp.
Andr. ii. 2. ll; Plaut. cist. i. 1. 120.—Enicet. Thus, occidis saepe
rogando, Hor. Epod. xiv. 5. — 8. Quid mihi quaeram. The pronoun

mihi is redundant here.
9. Ab eo gratiam hanc inibo. Inire gratiam is “to do a kindness to

one,” and by that means merit favour and good-will. Gratiam ab
eo inibo is therefore the same as if he had said, Gratiam ejus merebor, or
