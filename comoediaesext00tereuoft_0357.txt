wretched, stupid coxcomb! . . . and that rascal too Ξ ” ·— 29. Sacri-
legum. Put here for sceleratum—30. Tetigerim. Tangere, like the
Greek ἅπτεσθαι, signifies ‘⁴ to nettle with a sharp witty saying.'’ See
Muretus on Catull. xxi. 8. The Rhodians were particularly famous
both for their skill in naval affairs, and for their ready wit. They were,
besides, haughty and impatient of an affront. It was, therefore, much
to the captain's honour to have the better in a dispute with a Rhodian.
That we are to understand it so, is evident from the care which the
captain afterwards takes to remind us of the person's being a Rhodian.
— 32. Plus milies jam audivi. [Gnatho asides] ‘⁴ I’ve already heard
it o’er and o’er a thousand times! '’ Comp. i. 2. 5. — 34. Ad id alludere.
“ To make love to her.'’ Comp. Lactant. iii. 10. See Burmann on
Phaedr. iii. 19. 12. — 36. Lepus tute, διο. “ What l you a hare yourself,
and hunt for game !'' A proverbial expression in use at that time ;
and borrowed from the Greek, Δασύπους ὢν κρέως ἐπιθυμεῖς. We
leam from Donatus and Vopiscus, that Livius Andronicus had
inserted it in his plays before Terence. See casaubon. on Athen. iii. 3.
Pulpamentum signifies ‘⁶ the flesh of decr, hares,” διο. “ venison.”
Ego apros occido, sed alter fruitur pulpamenta. Vopisc. in Numer.

37. Quid est? The parasite had forced a laugh, the more easily to
impose upon Thraso, in making him believe that he had now first
heard this story. The captain asks, “ What’s the matter? ” with the
air and countenance of one who was sure os being commended, and to
give Gnatho an opportunity of launching out in his praises. —Nil
supra. “Incomparable.'’ Comp. Andr. i. 1. 933 Adesph. ii. 3. ll. -—
39. Fertur inprimis. ‘⁴ Nothing is more in fashion.'’ So Ruhnken,

“ citing Sueton. Caes. c. 20. Others render it thus : ‘⁴ It is in the highest

este-em ; ’⁷ “it is reckoned admirable.'' — Meum ⁹³15. “ ’Tis my own, Ι
assure you.” — 40. Dolet dictum imprudenti adulescenti, et libero. It
is not easy to conceive why Guyetus is for rejecting this verse, for it
comes in very aptly from Gnatho, who means to fiatter the captain, as
one so cutting in his railleries, that whoever drew his resentment upon
them, deserved heartily to be pitied. Imprudenti adulescenti, “ a
forward youth ;'’ one, perhaps, who little imagined that he would be
taken up so short, or that he had to do with a man who was so great a
master of wit. Liber may signisy here either one who was “free-
born,’' a youth of quality or rank, or it may imply freedom of speech.

41. At te Di perdant. [Parmeno asiam] “The gods confound
you!” At is a particle of anger and indignation. Thus, At vobis
mala multa Dii Deaeque dent, Catull. xxviii. 14. See note on Andr. iv.
l. 43. It is sometimes a particle of admiration. Comp. iii. 5. 42. —
42. Risu emoriri. “They died with laughter...they laughed exces-
sively.” Γέλω ἔκθανον occurs in Homer, Od. Σ. 99. Emorirz‘ is an
antique form for emori. Comp. Plaut. Pseud. iv. 7. 125. Moriri is
found in Ovid, Met. xiv. 215. Donatus remarks that it was usual with
comio poets, in drawing ridiculous characters, to make them express
themselves foolishly, and sometimes put in their mouths wrong words,
which people of understanding never used. Such he takes the word
emoriri here to be. The remark in general may be just enough, but
his applying it to the word emoriri was going too far. I should rather
incline, says Patrick, to the opinion of those who think there is an
affectation of wit in the use of this word, i. e. that Thraso describing
here the laughter of all present, endeavours to give an example of it,
