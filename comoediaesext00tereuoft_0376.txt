338 sormones,

Ecl. iii. 16. — 7. Peniculo. “ With a sponge.” Peniculus, “ a long
piece of sponge,” used by servants for wiping and cleaning. See the
word in Festus. —- 8. Imperatoris virtutem. “ The valour of our
general,'’ meaning Thraso. -— 9. Hoc non posse steri. Supply videbam ,-
or repeat noveram from the foregoing verse. — Qui abstergerem volnera?
“ How otherwise could I wipe the wounds ?”

10. Qui, malum, alii? “ Who, the plague, are the others ‘3” —
Servat domi. “ Takes care of matters at hcme.” Comp. Andr. i. 3. 7.
- 11. Tu hosce instrue. [To Gnatho ε] “Do you draw up the van;
and I will bring up the rear.'’ Post principia was the station of greatest
safety in the army. To understand it rightly, we must know that the
early Romans called those who fronted the enemy, and fought in the
van, principes, or principia. Behind these were placed the hastati and
triarii. But in time the order of battle was changed, and instead of the
principes, the hastati were placed first, and the principes between them
and the triarii,· yet they still retained their first name. Thraso, there-
fore, places himself behind the middle line of the army, as being the
place of greatest safety. — 12. Ut hosce instruxit, διο. “ As soon as he
drew up his lines, he provided for his own safety by his choice of situa-
tion‚’' i. e. his post behind secures him a retreat. Both the van and the
middle battalions of the army must be beaten, before Thraso’s situation
could be reached. And as on the one hand he was out of danger from
the enemy’s attack 3 so on the other, he was in a place convenient for
ffight, if that should be needful. —— 13. Idem hoc jam, διο. “ Pyrrhus
used to do the same before now-’⁹ The Pyrrhus mentioned here was
the king of Epirus, one of the greatest generals of antiquity. — Viden'
tu, Thais, &c. [Here Chremes and Thais appear above at a wind0w.]

15. Vir. “ Ahero.’' — Nebula. “ A coward.” — 16. Quidvidetur ?
[To Gnatho .·] “What seems best to be done ‘3⁹’ — Fundam tibi nnnc,
διο. “ I wish very much some one would give you a sling, that you
from far in ambush might attack them.” Nimis vellem is an expression
of Plautus, Asin. iii. 2. 42. -— 17. Facerentfugam. “ They would take
to their heels.” Facere fugam is used here in a strange signification3
though it occurs again in Sallust, Jug. c. 53. Comp. Sall. Jug. e. 58.
It properly signifies “ to put to flight‚” as in Livy, i. 56 3 viii. 9.
Terence perhaps introduced it here for the purpose of exciting a laugh.
—- 18. Quam moa irruimus ‚⁹ “ How soon shall we make the attack P’
ἱ. e. let us charge them instantly. This is said in derision. Irruere
is a military term. Comp. Adelph. i. 2. 8 3 iv. 2. 11. —- 19. Omnia
prius, &c. Comp. Andr. ii. 1. 11. —Quam armis. Supply experiri.
Terence uses this case here to make the captain appear ridieulous.
Bentley reads arma, which destroys the pleasantry of the passage. -·-
Experiri armis is the same syntax as legibus experiri. Ruhnken appr-oves
of Bentley’s reading. -- 22. Cum tibi do. To speak correctly he should
have said, cum tibi darem. - 23. Quid tum postea ? “ Well, and what
then ‘2⁹’ This is a formula of admitting a charge, and at the same time
despising the accuser. Tum postea are joined by pleonasm. See Voss.
de Comtr. c. 63 3 and Broukhus. on Propert. ii. 2. 14. Dies in this
verse is a monosyllable. — 24. Ante⁸ oculos coram. Ante oculos and
coram are not synonymous, as Donatus observes3 the former may
imply “at a distance ;” but the latter always signifies “full in on‘e's'
presence.” Comp. Heaut. v. 4. 18 ; Plaut. Rad. iv. 4. 3.

25. Quid cum illoc agas ? Muretus, Bentley, Ruhnken, and Perlet,
