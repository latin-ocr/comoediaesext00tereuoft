these slaves at Athens, to carry them to Cyprus: but that they had
been bought at Cyprus to carry to Athens; and upon this supposition,
he changes and alters the text at pleasure. But he seems to have for-
gotten, that it was the practice of the merchants to range all over
Greece‚ and buy up women-slaves to sell thern at a celebrated fair,
which was held at Cyprus ; and that the profits which Greece‚ especially
the Athenians‚ drew from this commerce‚ was the cause of their grant-
ing so many privileges to slave-merchants. - 23. Eo. “ To Cypru,s.” —

28. Jamne enumerasti id, Sec. [Sannio, who retired a short distance
from Syrus, had now for some time been reasoning with himseff. Syrus at
length coming up close to him, says :] “Well, have you yet calculated
the gains that will accrue from your voyage.’' This passage has been
generally understood as referring to the price of the music-girh whereas
it is really a piece of cunning in Syrus, to turn the discourse to
another subject, and, by his seeming indifference, increase the fears
and anxiety of Sannio. He demands, therefore, whether he had com-
puted what gains he expected to make by his voyage to Cyprus, which,
as it made Sannio sensible that they knew the necessity he was under,
was likely to bring him sooner to submit to their terms. — 29. Hoccine
