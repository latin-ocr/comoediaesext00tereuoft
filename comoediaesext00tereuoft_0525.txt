ACT ΙΙ. Scmm ΙΙ.

While Laches is thus engaged with Sostrata, Phidippus, the father
of Philumena, is seen coming out from his own house, and discoursing
with his wife and daughter within. He as little knew the real reason of
Philumena’s leaving her mother-in-law‚ as the other, and imputes it to
the same cause. His character is that of an easy, good-natured man,
who loves peace, and would rather give way to his family than bear
the pain of too violent an opposition. Laches commends him for his
temper, but thinks he is apt to carry it too far, and would, therefore,

have him alter his mind, and send back his daughter, which the other
will by no means agree to.
