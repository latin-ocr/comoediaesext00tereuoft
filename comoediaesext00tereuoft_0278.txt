“Here we take our last leave of Sosia, who is, in the language of ,ἐ

0110 who appears only once in the beginning (the protasis) of the piece, ¹-
for the sake of unfolding the argument, and 15 never seen in any other 3
part of the play. The narration being ended, says Donatus, the 1
character of Sosia 15 110 longer necessary. He therefore departs, and
leaves Simo alone to carry on the aetion. With all due deference to ,ἰ
1110 3110101115, Ι 03111101 help thinking this method, if too constantly ἲ
practised, as I think it is in our author, rather inartificial.Na1-ration, j
however beautiful, is certainly the deadest part of theatrical composi- q
tions; it is indeed, strictly speaking, scarce dramatic, and strikes the ς·
least in the representation: and the too frequent introduction of a ,ἶ
character, to whom a principal person in the fable is to relate in confi· J
dence the circumstances previous to the opening of the play, is surely Ξ
too direct a manner of conveying that infor-marion to the audienee. ἦ
Every thing of ‘this nature should come obliquely‚ fall in a manner by· ἒ

111 1110 0011150 of the action: a practice, which if reckoned highly ·⁵-
beautiful in epic, may be almost set down as absolutely necessary in
dramatic poetry. It 15, however, more advisable even to seem tedicus,

than to hazard being obscure. Terence certainly opens his plays with ν

being so communicative to the other; and yet it is too plain that the
narration is made merely for the sake of the auffience, since there Ἰ
never was a duller hearer than master Sosia, and it never appears in
the sequel of the play, that Simo’ s instructions to him are of the least
use to srighten Davus, or work upon Pamphilus. Yet even this protatic ἒ
personage is one of 1110 instances of Terence' s art, since it was often ‘f'
usual in the Roman comedy, as may be seen even in Plautus, to make ᾗ
1110 relation of the argument the express office of the Prologue. Sir
Richard Steele has opened the Conscious Lovers in direct imitation of
the Andriam, but has unfolded the argument with much less art, 33 will Ξ

perhaps appear in the course of the notes on this act. In this place it

is sufficient to observe, that the delineation of the charactersp‘ m the
English author is infinitely inferior to that of those 111 1110 Roman. ,
Simo is the most finished character m the play. Sir John Bevil,1
sear, is but an insignificant personage. Hum phry, while he has nu
1110 plainness and dullness of Sosia, possesses neither his fidelity nor
secrecy3 for he goes between the father and the son, and m 301110
measure betrays both? ’.—Colman
