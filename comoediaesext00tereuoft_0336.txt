298 emmenum

TheobaId is ¹of opinion th'at the following passagef‘firomzthe· Troilus and ·
Cressida of Shakespeare is partly imitated from this of Terence ε. ·

“ To be wise· and love ,
Exeeeds man's might, and dwells with gods above*

Colman observes, that if it be really an imitation, Shakespeare in this
instance, contrary to custom, falls infinitely below his originah— 18.

“Leave me to- myself.” Sine and sine modo are expressions of vexa-- ⁴
tion, much used by the comio poets. Comp. iv. 6. 1 ; Plaut. Asin. v. 2.

force be squeezed.” -24, Et te ultro accusabit. Some explain ultra
here by praeterea, or insuper, as in Virg. AEn. i'i. 145, et miserescimus
ultro. Others more properly, perhaps, by sine causa, “unjustly.”

ei supplicium. “ And you shall smart severely at her hands, and yet-
submissively.’' This is the meaning of ultro in this place. Colman
seems to have misunderstood supplicium here. His translation is thir.
“You, too, shall own th' offence, and pray for pardon.” Comp. Andr.

29. Ut te redimas· captum, &e. “That you redeem yourself from

those it has bear bravely.'' It stood thus m the Eunuch of Menander:
Μὴ θεομάχει, μηδὲτπροσῶτγου τῷ πράγματι Χειμῶνας ἑτέρους, τοὺς· duay—
καίους φέρε. - 34. Sed ecca ipsa, διο. “But lo! she comes, ,our rui-n
comes l For she, like storms of hail on fields of corn, beats down out
hopes, aud carries all before her.” There is an extreme elegance ιιι
this passage. A similar sentiment occurs in the first act of the Cymbe-
la‘ne of Shakespeare:
‘¹ Comes in my rathen

And, like the—tyrannous breathing of the north,
snakes all our buds from blowing.'’
