ACT ΙΙΙ. ὃοΕΝΕ ΙΙ.

The poet by the short conversation between Canthara and Sostrata
in the preceding scene, prepares for what is to happen here. While
they are discoursing about AEschinus‚ and praying for his safety, Geta
appears. He chanced to be passing along the street where Sannio
lived, when the scuffle happened, and saw AEschinus carry off the music-
⁴girl by force. It was natural enough for him to conclude, that all this
was done on his own account3 and.that the music-girl must be some
new mistress he had fallen in love with. Geta, who was Sostrata's
servant, one well affected to the family, and whose labour and industry
was their chief support, bewails bitterly this alarming missortune.
AEschinus, he thought, was now quite alienated from them3 want and
infamy threatened them; nor was the calamity such as admitted any
alleviation. These complaints are overheard by Sostrata, who goes
up to him to inquire the cause.

Of this scene verses 1-4, 7—-18‚ 22, 32—56, are Tetrameter
Iambics Acatalectic; verses 5, 6, 20, 21, 23-31, Tetrameter Trochaics
Catalectic; and vs. 19, a Dimeter Iambic.

stage] Here nostrum infortunium must be supplied: ‘⁴ Now such is
our misfortune, that if all mankind were to unite in consultation, and
seek a remedy for this disaster which has fallen on me,” &c. -- Consilia
