on their true meaning. His words are : Nihil suave meritum est .· hoe
est, nihil est‘tanti, nihil est pretii, aut lucri tam magni, quod libens
capiam, si habendum sz't ea conditione, at hoc feram. Ruhnken adopts
this interpretation, adding: Ita, hunc locum egregie explicat magnus
Gronovius, Obss. in Script. Eccles. vii. 77 ; and then refers us to Cicero,
Nat. Deor. i. 243 Philipp. i. 44. Meritum ’st is the reading of all the
’ manuscripts and early editions. Bentley reads m‘l suave merita ’ste
“ She has deserved nothing lenient at our hands ;” she who, by fraud,
has imposed on my son, claiming relationship to him, and hence in·
truded herself into our family. Bentley might, perhaps, with better
effect, have carried his emendation a little further, Nic sane merita ἐι.

Phaedria, we have seen, in the end of the last act, had been despatched
to find out Phormio; but, instead of doing sc, he pays a visit to Dorio,
the master of the music-girl. Geta in the mean time meets Phormio,
and informs him of all that had happened, particularly of Antipho’s
terror and flight upon seeing his father. This rouses Phormio, who
plainly perceives he must take the whole burden upon himself.
