redundant. Comp. ii. 3. 473 iii. 5. 56; Adesph. iv. 1. 13. Both par-
ticles are used, as here, Eun. ii. 3. 79.

11. Ne videndi quidem erit? “Shall 1 not at least have the privilege
of seeing her ?” Comp. Ovid‚ Met. iii. 478. — 12. Certe extrema
linea, διο. “ And certainly, love, in its last degree, is something still.'‘
This is supposed to be a metaphor drawn from the courses of chariots,
where, in turning round the goal, he who is nearest, is said currere in
prima linea ,· the next to him, in secunda ,· and so on to the last, who
runs in extrema linea. This has some resemblance to the several
degrees of love, where the lowest pleasure is seeing the person loved,
,and what the poet here calls amare in extrema linea. — 13. Villam prae-
tereo sciens. “ Then I on purpose passed my country house.’' See
vs. 5. -— 14. Timida. For turbata, commota, ‘⁴ affrighted.” Comp.
(aggelph. iii. 2. 7. —Egreditur. “ Hurries forth” from the house of

ACT IV. Scmm III.

Chaerea, who had been introduced to Thais in the Eunuch's dress,
'had by this time made his escape. Pythias, followed by Dorias, who
now comes to know what has happened, runs out in great haste to look
for him, and meeting Phaedria, tells him all3 he, thinking it impos—
sible‚ concludes they are drunk, or had lost their senses. Willing,
however, to examine a little into the matter, he returns home to see if
he can find the Eunuch, and learn the cause of his running away.

Of this scene verses 1 and 2 are Tetrameter Trochaics Acatalectic,
the latter having a Tribrach in the last place; verses 3, 7, 11-13,
Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic; verses 4, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15, 17—25,
Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic ; and 5, 10, 16, Dimeter Iambics.

l. Ubi ego illum. [Enter Pythias and Dorias: Phaedria at a distance.]
—- Scelerosum. According to Gellius, iv. 9, this word is more forcible
than sceleratus. It is used by Lucr. i. 84. -3. Ludificatus 'st. For
vitia-vit, corrupit. Comp. Hec. i. 2. 74⁴3 Tacit. Ann. vii. 2; Sil. Ital.
viii. 642. -4. Ipsam capillo conscidit. This construction is unusual.
In Justin, however, (i. 10.) we find lacerari toto corpore. Scindere
capillos is the usual phrase. Comp. Ovid, Epist. xx. 81. —— 5. Si detur
mihi. Supply obviam. ‘⁴ Oh, were he put within my reach.'‘ Comp.
Andr. v. 5. 6. Si detur milti is the language of an angry person.
Comp. Adelph. iii. 2. 13. where obviam is inserted in the text; and
Hor. od. iii. 27. 45. — 6. Ut ego, διο. “How readily would I fly at the
eyes of that villain with my nails!” Illi venefico, the dative for the
genitive. Involem, the same as cum vi irruam. Comp. v. 2. 20; Ovid,
Met. xii. 560. Venefico here means no more than scelerato .· yet see
what Donatus says. — 7. Nescio quid. The same as aliquid, ‘⁶ some·
thing.’' Comp. ii. 2. 6ος ii. 3. 7 ; Andr. v. 1. 22. “ Some disturbance
has arisen here during my absence.'’ — Absente nobis. For me absente,
by synthesis, regard being had to the sense of nobis, which is here
the same as me. Though “we'’ is now used as a singular by the
great, yet it was formerly a sign of modesty and humility. Nobis
praesente occurs in Plaut. Amph. ii. 2. 194; insperanti nobis, in Catull.
evii. 5 ; nobis merenti, in Tibull. iii. 6. 55. —- 9. In’ hinc quo dignus ἐ.
Supply ire. Hinc, i. e. in malam rem. Comp. Andr. v. 4. 37.
