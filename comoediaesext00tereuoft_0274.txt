by Manoa in the Samson Agonistes of Milton, which seems to be

partly borrowed from this passage :

‘⁴ 1 gain’d a son,
And such a son, as all men hail'd me happy;
Who would be now a father in my stead !'’

Compare Petron. c. 94. Ovid‚ Met. iv. 322.-70. Fortunas meas. γ
“ My happy lot.” The relative qui refers to the personal pronoun im·
plied in meas. If he could have said fortunas mei in imitation of Greek “

syntax, it would have referred to mei ,· or to me, had he said me fortuna*-
tum. Comp. Ovid‚ ex Pont. iii. 4. 91.-—72. Quid verbis opus est?
“What need of many words?” or, ‘⁴ In short.’' Ruhnken says this
was a formula with the ancients‚ when they were about to prove their

words by some example. Comp. Eun. iii. 5. 20. ——— 75. Despondi. ‘⁴ Ι “

agreed to the match.'' Donatus distinguishes between spondere and
despondere, making the first proper to him who asked another in mar-
riage for his son or daughter, and the other to him who promised. But
the Latin writers do not seem to have made any such distinction. De-
spondere for the most part signifies no more than “to promise frankly.”
—Hic dictus'st dies. ⁴⁴ This day was fixed upon.”-—77. In diebus
paucis, διο. “ In a few days after these transactions.” The moremus]

phrase is, in paucis diebus, quam, as in Sueton. Tib. c. 60, where quam ·

stands for postquam. Ruhnken says, in diebus paucis is put for post
paucos dies. — 78. Ο factum bene I ‘⁴ O happy chance !’' A usual
expression of joy. Comp. v. 6. 5 ς Phorm. v. 1. 24· ; catull. iii. 16.

The same occurs in Livy, xxiii. 36. It may, however, be rendered, ‘⁴ Ι
dreaded some mischief from Chrysis.'' — Ibi tum. Ibi here is the same
as tum, therefore there is apleonasm in these words. ΤῙιιιε we find
itaque ergo in Livy, iii. 31. But, ita sz'c armatus, Livy, ii. 10, cited by
Ruhnken as pleonastic, is not so, and should be translated, ‘⁴ Ha ”
thus spoken, armed as he was.’' -— 80. Frequens. For the adverb ,sire-⁴

κ means illi frequentes, “they in great numbers.’' -81. Curabat. Curare,
ἡ as well as κομίζειν, is a word peculiar to funeral preparations. Funus
means the pomp and every thing appertaining to funeral obsequies.
Donatus says it is derived a funalibus, ‘⁴ from the torehes ;” because all
,funerals were anciently solemnized in the night-time by torch-lightoe—
82. Nonnunquam collacrumabat. ‘⁴ He sometimes even wept with them.”

been his most intimate friend.” Familiariter. Literally ‘⁴ intimately‚¹’
