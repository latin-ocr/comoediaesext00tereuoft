10. Atque in Thesauro. In the Thesaurus, or “ Treasure,'’ of
Lavinius, a young man, having squandered his estate, sends a
servant ten years after his father's death, according to the will of

had before sold the ground, in which the monument stood, to a
covetous old man, to whom the servant applied to help him to open
the monument. Here they discovered a hoard of gold and a letter.
The old fellow seizes the treasure, and keeps it, under pretence of
having placed it there for safety during the times of war. The young
man goes to law with him ς and the old man is represented as opening
the cause thus τ

Terence ridicules this, because the young man who was the plaintiff
should first show his own title to it. — Causam dicere. “To plead.’'
11. Unde petitur. The possessor and defendant in the suit. -— 12.
Quam illic. Supply causam dicat .- otherwise it should have been quam

deceive himself, or c-ry I'm safe: he can say nought of me.’' —— 15.
Defunctus jam sum. ‘⁴ Ι now go off with applause ;'' or, “I am now
out of danger.” Defungor, like ἀπαλλάττομαι, signifies ‘⁴ I discharge,’'
“go through,'’ “ undergo‚’' “get rid of,” “ am freed from.'' Comp.

17. Nunc quae condonabitur. Condonare is sometimes construed with a
double accusative, one of the person, and the other of the thing.
The accusative of the thing is retained in the passive. Comp. Phorm.
v. 7. 54. Thus also we say, docere aliquem philosophiam, and in

shall be produced and made public.” -— 21. Perfecit, διο. “He
obtained permission to examine it.’' -— The word inspiciundi, says
Colman, certainly carries a stronger sense than merely to be
present at the representation. The meaning of the whole passage
1 take to be this: that having obtained leave to peruse the MS. he
furnished himself with objections against the piece, which he threw out
when it came to be rehearsed before t-he magistrates—22. Ibi.
Here an adverb of time, and is put for tum, or ibi tum. Comp.
Andr. i. 1. 7 9.-- Occepta’st agi. This, says Madame Dacier, is a

bought a piece, they had it represented at their own house before it
was played in public.

Andr. i. 3. 6. Others interpret these words thus:.'12he poet⁴ had not
