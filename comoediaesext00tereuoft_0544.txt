ACT IV. Serum III.

Laches, who had overheard all that passed in conversation between
his wife and son, here joins them, and urges Sostrata to executa her
design without delay. Pamphilus interposes, and would prevent it,
but in vain; the old man is inflexible. While they are thus engaged,
Laches observes Phidippus coming out to them, which interrupta their
conversation. κ

-4, Fors fuat pol. “ Fortune, perhaps, may prove favourable.”
The ancients sometimes used the verb suo for sum : and we have an
instance in Virgil, AEn. x. 108: Tros Rutula-sve suat. The above is
according to the interpretation of Donatus, who is followed by
Ruhnken and many others. It is more likely, as Schmieder observes,
that fors fuat is a sarcastical repetition of fortasse in the speech of
Laches,—-“ perhaps so!’' Fors fuat for sors sit, i. e. forsit, the same
as fortasse. Fors fuat for sortasse occurs in Sidon. Apol. Epist. ix. 7,,
and in Auson. Epist. 16. Colman renders it, “ And let it be 2 ’⁹ with -
this remark: Madame Dacier refines prodigiously on these three
words, and supposing great difficulty in them, explains them by a very
long periphrasis Donatus seems to consider them mere words of
assent, agreeable to the mild character of Sostrata; and if Ι might
venture to correct a French translation, Ι would say that Madame
Dacier might have rendered them more properly by the common
expression of ὰ la bonne heure! Patrick translates these words, ‘⁴ It
may be so, perhaps‚” supposing Sostrata to have answered in a huff.
