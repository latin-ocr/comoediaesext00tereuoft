Syrus, in the first part of his speech, had left it to Clitipho’ s choice
which to prefer—either pleasure, with the dangers attending it, or to
deny himself the one, rather than be exposed to the other. But as*
he is unwilling all h’is pains and labour should be lost, he here cun-
ningly insinuates, that he may indulge himself to the full without
fear; for he has laid his measures so well, that his mistress may be
at his father’ s house without danger of discovery, and he has also a
sure expedient for obtaining the money that had been promised to
her. —Rectam Comp. Ean. iv. 7. 14. —Tatum “Free from danger.”

96. Nil satis firmi video. ‘⁶ Ι see no solid grounds to make me hazard
this.’' Comp. Sall. Jug. c. 64. -— 97. Habeo aliud. “ Ι have another
plan. '’ Syrus is here disgusted and angry to find a scheme which he
had flattered himself was well— contrived‚ so lightly thought· of by his ’
master. This answer is, therefore, a mixture of* irony and indignation‚
it being his design to go and order Bacchis to return home3 for he
saw that his master was not likely by any other means to be roused.
The irony is heightened by Clitipho' s taking what Syrus says here
as serious. - 98. Hujusmodz' obsecro, διο. “Do, prithee, find out
something of that kind.’' -— Maxume, διο. “ By all means : I will go
and meet her, and desire her to return home.” Huic. Bacchis. This
is an emendation of Bentley: the former reading was hinc. —— 100.
