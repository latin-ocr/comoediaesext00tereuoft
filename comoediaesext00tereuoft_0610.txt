572 Pnonmo.

these words are addressed to the spectatore, intimating that Chremes
had been terrified to death: and they support this opinion by vs. 37.

27. Tua . . . tuo. These are put for tui. Comp. Heaut. ii. 3. 66. —30.
Ea mortem obiit, e medio abiit. Demipho dwells upon this circumstance,
repeating it, as upon this his hopes of being able to bring about a recon-
ciliation chiefly depended. And here we ought to observe how judi-
ciously the poet has conducted his plot, in contriving to remove the
Lemnian wife out of the way. For had she been still alive, it must
have proved an insurmountable obstacle to the reconciling of the several
parties. —· Quisuz‘t in re hac serupulus. “ Who was the ‘only grievance
in this matter.'' Qui here properly agrees with scrupulus. ——31. Ut
, alia tua sunt facta. “As is your wonted goodness.” Comp. v. 3.1.
ἶ —- 32. Cupio misera, &c. ‘¹ Alas ! I wish my miseries might end
here !‘' Comp. Adelph. iii. 4«. 63. Others render it, “ Iwish his vices
might end here.'' Ruhnken maintains the former, and Schmieder the
latter interpretation. Madame Dacier gives it quite a different turn:
Je vena: rompre avec lui pour majoma—33. Sed qui sperem? “ But
how can Ι hope for such a change 2⁷³ —- 34. Senectus si verecundos facit ,⁹
·‘ If age makes men modest ?’' -— 36. Quid mi affers ,Ρ “ What proof do
you bring me‚” διο,

37. Exeqaias Cremetz’, &c. “ Whoever would attend the funeral of
Chremes, now’s the time !'’ What creates the drollery of this speech
is, that Phormio here makes use of the same terms which it was cus·
tomary to use at the proclamation of a funeral: of which the usual
formula was this : L. T1T1Us vrxrr. L. T1T10 exeamas nu: cm
COMMODUM sssr. ΗΕΜ 1 TEMPUS Es'r. OLLus ECFERTOR. Comp. Sil.
Ital. xv. 394. -- 38. Sic dabo. Supply malum. A formula of insolent
threatening3 “Thus will I serve him.’' Comp. Plaut. Menaeeh. iv. 2.
40. Phormio triumphs in the success of his scheme. He imagines
himself invincible, and talks in the genuine style of a vain parasite,
conceited of his own wit, and who imagines himself an over-match for
., every body. —-— 39. Faaeo eum tali mactatum. ‘⁴ Ι will heap the same
missortunes on him.” This manner of speaking is very familiar to

Plautus. Mactare, in its proper and original signification, is equivalent
to magis augere. It is thus Horace uses it, Sat. i. 2. 31. Hence we
meet with the phrase mactare Deos hostia, both in Plautus and Cicero.
So also mactare honori bus, “ to heap honours upon.’' It afterwards sig-
nified ‘⁶ to immolate,'’ or “sacrifice ;'' and thence “to slay.’' Colman’s
translation of this passage is : “ He shall fall a victim to me.’' For
the construction of faxo macyatum see Adelph. v, 9. 34. -4l. Habet
laec, &c. ‘⁶ She has something now to din into his earS,” &a
42. At meo merim, credo. “ I have deserved it, forsooth !’' At eredo
> is osten used ironically‚ as here. — 44. Mtnume gentium. “ Not at all.”
Comp. Eun. iv. 1. 11. —- 45. Quando jam, διο. Simonides ε Τὸ ’γὰρ
’γεγενημένον οὐκ ἐτ’ ἅῤῥηκτον ἔσται. —47. Enimvero, priusquam, &e.
[Phormio aside :] “ Really, before she grants this pardum I must
secure myself and Phaedria.’' Comp. Heaut. v. 2. 8. - 51. Hem .' quid
ais ? [Chremen angrily :] “ How! what say you ’.Ψ - 53. Nil pudere P
“ Are you not ashamed ?‘' For this use of the infinitive see ii. 1. 3. —-
