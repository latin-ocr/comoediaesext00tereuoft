Ac‘r v. scmm iv. 28¹7

ACT V. Scmm IV.

In this scene, Chremes, by means of Crito, comes to know that
Glycerium was his own daughter ; which immediately reconciles Simo
to his son’s amour, and raises Pamphilus to the height os his wishes.
It appears from what Crito says, as he is coming out of the house of
Glycerium, that Pamphilus had been requesting him to do his utmost
to convince the old men that she was really an Athenian.

The first twenty-five verses are Tetrameter Trochaics Catalecti03 the
rest, Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic.
