Patrick observes on this, that the poet's conduct here is justly liable to
censure: the only consideration that can be urged in his defence is,
that he meant to show the inconveniences arising from too unbounded
a good-nature. But Micio has all along been represented so agreeable
and possessed osso much judgment, good sense, and knowledge of the
world, that this last piece of extravagance must shock probability, and
offend the delicacy of the spectator. Donatus gives us the *following
short note; Apud Menandrum senem de nuptiis uon gravatur. Ergo =
Terentius εὑρητικῶς. Itis surprising, says Colman, that none of the
critics on this passage have taken notice of this observation of Donatus,
especially as our loss of Menander makes it rather curicus. It is plain
that Terence, in'the plan of his last act, followed Menander3 but though
he has adopted the absurdity of marrying Micio to the old lady, yet
we learn from Donatus that his judgment rather revolted at this cir-
cumstance; and he improved on his original, by making Micio express
, a repugnance to such a match, which it seems he did not in the play

of Menander. — Bene facis. Comp. Eun. i. 2. 106. - 23. Merito tuo
