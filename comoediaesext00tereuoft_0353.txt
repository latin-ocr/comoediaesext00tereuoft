added further, that she has not lived long in the neighbourhood, and the
young fellow has been chiefly at the Piraeus. -— Sane. “ Ay, truly.” --
At nihil ad nostram hanc. “ But nothing to compare to this of
mine.'’ Ad, like πρὸς of the Greeks, is elegantly used in comparison.
Thus in Cic. de Orat. ii. 6, nihil ad Persium. Comp. iv. 4. 14. - Alia
res. “ Quite another thing.” This is used concerning things which
cannot be compared. We say, “ There is no comparison.'' See what
Parmeno had said with himself, ii. 1. 25. — 72. Num quid me aliud ?
“ Have you any other commands sor me?‘’ This was a formula used
at parting. Comp. i. 2. 111; ii. 1. 7.-74. O fortunatum Eunuchum.
Here we come to the grand scheme upon which the play chiefly turns3
which, as Donatus observes, is so managed by the poet, that it seems
rather to offer itself, than to be the contrivance of Parmeno. - 76.
Videbit, colloquetur. Achil. Tat. lib. i.: Σὺ δὲ βλέπεις ἀεὶ, καὶ ἀκούσειε
ἀεὶ, καὶ συνδειπνεῖς, καὶ συμνίνεις. Sappho: Φαίνεταί μοι κεῖνος teos

i. 51. - 77. Propter. For prope or juxta. Comp. Adelph. iv. 2. 37 ;
Cic. pro Rosc. Amer. c. 23.-80. Audio. “1 am attentive.” Audio
is used here in the signification of assenting. Comp. Phorm. ii. 1. 6 ;
Cic. ad Div. ii. 7. It is used in a different sense in Andr. iii. 3. 20;
on which see the note. — 83. Quisquam. The ancients used this word
in the feminine as wellas in the masculine. Comp. iv. 4. 11.— 84. Forma
'et oetate ipse es. “ You are of such form and age.’' ——- Probes. Supply
te. Probare se pro Eunucho is the same as persuadere aliis, se esse
Eunuchum. Comp. Cic. Verr. v. 30. See Ruhnken on Rutil. Lup.
i. p. 15.

86. Orna me. “Dress me.” Comp. iv. 4. 16.—— Quantum potest.
“ With all possible haste.” See note on Andr. v. 2. 20. -- 88. Quo
trudis? It is usual in comedy to make the reader sensible, by the
words -of some one of the speakers, of what cannot be exhibited but
on the stage; as, in the present instance, we understandssfrom the words
of Parmeno, that Chaerea was pushing him. — Perculeris jam tu me.
“ You will throw me down.’' Percellere properly signifies “ to over-
throw‚” or “ subvert.’' Percellunt magnas quercus. Ennius, cited by
Macrob. Saturn. vi. 2. Perculeris the future perfect, in place of the
future imperfect. Comp. Heaut. i. 1. 563 Phorm. iv. 3. 76.—89.
Certum ἐι. “ Ι am determined.'' — Vide ne, &c. Constr. Vide ne
modo, &c. “ Beware lest this prove too hot for you.'’ -— 90. At enim,
&c- “ But then I shall have to pay sor all.'’ Comp. Adelph. ii. 1.,14.
In me cudetur faba is a proverbial expression, the origin of which is
not certainly known. Some consider it taken from the threshing of
beans; others, from the cooks dressing them, who, when they had not
boiled them sufficiently, but left them hard and tough, were sure to
have them thrown at their heads. The Scholiast on Persius derives it
from a whip wherewith slaves were punished, having knots partly
resembling the figure of a bean. However commentators differ as
to the manner of explaining these words, yet they all agree in this
sense, that Parmeno was to suffer the punishment of all.

91. An id flagitium. Donatus observes here, that Terence obliquely
defends, by this passage, the subject of the comedy. -92. Et illis
