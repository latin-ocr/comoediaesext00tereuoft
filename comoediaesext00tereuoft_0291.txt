Acr 11. SCENE 111. 253

ACT 1-1, Scnm: III.

Pamphilus, now left alone with Davus, and convinced by what he had
heard that Chremes had no thought of giving him his daughter, is at a
loss to conceive what his father could mean by such a pretence. Davus,
whose character is that of a shrewd, cunning, penetrating slave, easily
conjectures the true reason, and advises Pamphilus to pretend to his
father that he is willing to marry, from which counsel new troubles arise.

Of this scene the first nine verses are Tetrarneter Trochaics Catalec-
tic3 verses 10 to 19 inclusive, Trimeter Iambics; and the remainder,
Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic.

1. Quid sz’bz' volt pater? “ What, then, does my father mean?”
Elegantly for quid vult. Comp. ii. 6. 26 3 Propert. i. 5. 3 ; Hor.
Epod. xii. 1 ; and see Duker on Sil. Ital. v. 46. — Cur simulat ? Comp.
i. 1. 130. - 2. Sz· z‘d suscenseat. ‘⁴ If he were angry now merely on this
account.” Id for propter id. Comp. Eun. iii. 1. 3. The particle sub, K
when it enters into composition, generally denotes a thing that is done 4
privately‚ or to one‘s sels. Such, therefore, who, after the rates fixed ’ἵ
by the censors, complained that they were taxed beyond their estate, -.
were said properly suscensere, that is, says Westerhovius‚ clanculum re- ’
censere. Hence, suscensere is often used for subirasci, iniquo am'mo
serre, stomachari, as here, and afterwards ii. 6. 17. -— 3. Ipsus sibi esse

quam, διε. “ Before he shall have clearly seen how your mind is dis-
posed towards the marriage.’' Perspexerit animum, ut, δίο. is a Greek
mode of construction. Ut sese habeat also is a Greek idiom. Comp.
Adelph. iii. 3. 10 ; Livy, v. 5. Perspicere signifies to see fully and
plainly.——5. Ibi. ‘⁴ Then.'’ Comp. Eun. ii. 2. 30. —Culpam iu te,
διο. Comp. i. 1. 131. — 6. Tum illae turbae. ‘⁶ And then such storms.”
-7. Dzfficile’st. “To oppose him is difficult.’' —Sola ‘⁶ Unpro-
tected.'’ Comp. i. 5. 55. —Dictum acfactum. “ Instantly.’' This is ς
a proverbial formula, similar to our “ No sooner said than done.” It 3
occurs again Heaut. iv. 5. 12; and, without the conjunctim, dictum ’
factum, Heaut. v. 1. 31; and seems to be copied from the Greek, ἅμα
ἔπος, ἅμα ἔργον · or λεχθὲνκαὶ πραχθέν. In Virgil, AEn. i. 142, we read
dicto citius. Comp. Livy, xxiii. 47; Petron. c. 80. —- 8. Causam. “ A ν
pretext.” — Eiciat oppido. That is, says Westerhovius, by means of the
magistrates. Ἐκβάλλειν τῆς πόλεως are the words of Menander.
Eiciat for ejiciat. So reice in Virgil, Ecl. iii. 96. Quamobrem here is
a dissyllable. —9. Cedo igitur. ‘⁶ Tell me then.’' Comp. i. 1. 123.
— 10. Egon' dicam ‚⁹ This is pronounced with emphasis on the pro-
noun. “ What, shall Ι say so ?—I, who am under engagements to
Glycerium— Ι, who have no manner of attachment to Philumena, and
who abhor deceit 2⁵³ The reciprocal dissimulation between the father
and the son in the fable of this comedy, is much better managed by
Terence than by Sir Richard Steele. The efforts made by each party,
11} order to accomplish the favourite point which they severally have in
vlew, very naturally keeps all the characters in motion, and produces
rnany affectmg and pleasant situations. There is too much uniformity
m the adventures, as well as the character of Bevil, for the vivacity of
thedrama. His supposed consent to marry is followed by no conse.-
