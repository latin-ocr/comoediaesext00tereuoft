are few scenes of comedy more truly humorous than the situation and
behaviour of the two old gentlemen at the conclusion of this act.
The natural but uncommon conduct of Pamphilus; its effect upon
Phidippus; the latter’s treatment of Laches, and abrupt departure;
and then again the emotion of Laches on the usage he had experienced
from his son and his neighbour, are all very pleasant, and must
produce an admirable effect in the representation.

 

ACT IV. Scmm I.

In the last scene Phidippus leaves Laches in a great huff, as being
offended at the haughty behaviour of Pamphilus. It is no wonder, if
thus disgusted, he resolves to use no constraint with his daughter, but
leave it to her own choice to stay or return. But what happens in this
scene gives a very different turn to his way of thinking. For coming·v
directly home, after he left Laches, it chanced to be soon.after his
daughter was delivered, and he overheard the child’s eries: upon
which, running to Philumena’s apartment, he finds how it is.
Immediately he runs to his wife, and expostulates warmly with her,
for concealing a thing of that importance from hin1; and as it was
plainly her design to have destroyed the child, he throws the whole
blame of the separation upon her, who, having taken a dislike to
Pamphilus, endeavours to withdraw her daughter and make an irre-
coneilable breach between them. This greatly perplexes Myrrhina,
and makes'her doubt how far Pamphilus would be able to keep their
secret, as another’s child was likely to be bred for his.

Madame Dacier joins this scene to the third act, and assigns verse 7
as her reason for it. The old division, however, seems to be right.
This scene brings on a new part of the plot, which occupies the rest of
the fourth act. The continuity of the scenes being broken at the
departure of Myrrhina, proves nothing, or too much: for Terence
osten takes that liberty in the middle of an act, and the scene is
certainly left vacant by Laches. Resides, Myrrhina does not, as
Madame Dacier asserts, leave the house immediately on the entrance
,of Phidippus, in order to avoid him; but is frightened out of doors by
his running to Philumena's chamber, on hearing the eries of the child.
