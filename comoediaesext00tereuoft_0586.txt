“What a monstrous crime! sold a slave, bought with his own ready
money !'’ [These words are supposed to be addressed by Dorio to the
spectators, with a sarcastical air.] It is worth while to observe the
different manners of the speakers. Phaedria expresses himself with
tenderness and love: he calls her meam Pamphilam. Dorio again uses
the undervaluing epithet ancum—28. Cum illo ut mutet fidem. For·

The entire blame is attributed to Phaedria's want of money. Schmieder
gives neque ego to Antipho, and neque tu to Dorio 3 thus,

Antipho was proceeding to add, “ And cannot I persuade you ;” when
he was interrupted by Dorio, “ N either you nor any other person, shall
induce me to alter my determination.’' Bothe reads Neque ego necto,
the words istam amorem being understood from the former line. —-
