syrusjn good time.’' The mutual artifices of these two arc set off
with all the enlivening circumstances of which they are capable.
Chremes rejoices to meet with Syrus, that of him he might learn how
uie plot against Menedemus was managed and succeeded. Syrus,
again, was no less pleased to meet with Chremes, whom he afterwards
greatly over-reached without being in the least suspected. —- Cesso

10. Quid est ? These are the wo‘rds of Chremes, anxious to learn of
Syrus how the plot was going on. Madame Dacier and Westerhovius
think they should be given to Syrus 3 because quid est? was the>
common answer of a person called by another. —- Jamdudum. “ Long

17. Vah! gloriare evenisse, διο. Syrus, in answer to Chremes, insi-
nuating his desire· to know what was done with Menedemus, said, De
illo quod dudum? dictum ac factum reddidi. Whence Chremes con-
Jectured, that Menedemus had been already deceived, according to the

q scheme concerted between them: and so much the more, as Syrus,
afterwards, upon being further intermgated, answers bona (fide).
Syrus, then seeing that Chremes was highly pleased, and commended
him, could not resist the vanity of endeavouring to heighten the merit
of his artifice, At si scias quam scite in mentem venerit. [Here Chremes
duee-ks him .·] “Do you boast of it? Do you want to make it appear
greater than it is?’' [Syrus answers .·] “ No, indeed, I only speak the
truth.’'
