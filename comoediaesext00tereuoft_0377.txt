give this to Thtaso, and supply nisi quod meretricis est. Others give
it to Thais, rendering it, “What business have you with him ?'’ or,
‘⁶ What is that to you?'’ -— 26. Lubuit. “ It was my pleasure.’' This
is the language of haughtiness. Comp. Cic. Verr. i. 52. — Huc. For
mihi. In anger, as in the Hec. iii. 5. 52. - 27. Omnium. Aposiopesis,
as in the Andria, v. 3. 1. Pessime may be supplied.—28. Quid tu.
Tuis emphatic: for Thraso’s discourse was with Thais, and not with
Chremes. —— Tuam autem, furcifer. “ Yours, indeed, scoundrel !” The
particle autem in interrogations by way of reply, marks the indignation
of the speaker. Comp. iii. 2. 223 Adelph. ii. 1. 31. Donatus considers
this as a rude, unmannerly speech, coming from a mere rustic, and one
that was an utter stranger to politeness and civility. Others think it
rather said in the heat of passion and indignation 3 for that Thraso, by
claiming Pamphila as his property, made her a slave, which Chremes
could not bear. —30. Scin’ tu, ut tibi res, διο. “Do you know how
affairs stand with you ?” Comp. Phorm. ii. 3. 82. — 31. Faciam, ut, &c.

‘⁴ Ι will make you for ever remember‚'’ διο. A formula of threatening.
Comp. Plaut. Capt. iv. 2. 20.

33. Diminuam, &c. ‘⁴ I will break your head.'’ Comp. Adelph. iv. 2.
323 v. 2. 7. — Ain’ vero, canis? “ Say you so, you dog ‘2¹’ Vero is
used to mark the speaker’s indignation. See Drakenb. on Livy, xlv.
19. Canis is an insulting term applied to an enemy. Comp. Homer,
Il. Θ. 299. -- 34. Siccine agis? “ What, is that your way ?” Comp.
i. 2. 19 ; Adelph. i. 2. 48. — 35. Scibis. An old form for scies. -
Dico. Comp. ii. 2. 20. - 36. Os durum l ‘⁴ Consummate impudence !'’

’- Comp. Cic. pro Quint. c. 243 Sueton. Ner. c. 2; Ovid, Met. v. 451.

Madame Dacier ridiculously interprets this, “A hard bone, indeed!''
“A home thrust‚ really !” — 37. V im facias in illam. The same con-
,struction occurs v. 4. 41, but the dative is more usual. Comp. iv. 1. 2.
-— 38. Signa. Comp. iv. 6. 29. - 39. Furti se alligat. “ He im·
peaches himself of thest.” Comp. Cic. pro Flac. c. 17 ; Plaut. Poen.
iii. 4. 27. Farnaby remarks here, rei LlGAN‘rUR, innocentes absolvuntur.
-40. Satis tibi est ? “ Surely you need no other proof.” — Quaerc,

44. Dimitto exercitum ? A military phrase. Comp. Caes. B. C'. i. 3.
-45. Domi focique. There is a particular elegance and beauty in this
passage, on account of the ambiguity of the expression, and its being

and resolution, he always put them in mind that they were to fight for
their houses and families. Here Gnatho makes use of it to make them
quit their arms, and leave the field. In his mouth they are terms of
cookery, and a burlesque upon the military exhortation. These parti-
cular turns ought always to be taken notice of, as they serve more than
any thing else to give us an idea of the genius and manner of Terence.
Beaumont and Fletcher seem to have had their thoughts on this scene
iu their draught of the Mob-Regiment in Philaster. The old captain
“ disembodies his militia’' much in the same manner with Gnatho: —-
