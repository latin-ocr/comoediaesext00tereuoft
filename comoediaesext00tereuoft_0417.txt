ACT ΙΙΙ. Scmm Ι.

Here we have a fine representation of the duty which one friend
owes to another. Chremes, in the beginning of the play, had professed
an esteem and friendship for Menedemus, and all his behaviour
hitherto corresponds exactly with it. So soon as he hears of Clinia’s
arrival, he is for imparting the news to his neighbour‚ as knowing how
agreeable it would be to him. When, to remove Clinia’s groundless
fears, he had almost discovered the anxiety his father was under for his
absence, he suddenly changes his mind, as foreseeing that it would be
more to the advantage of his friend to suppress that; and now in this
scene, we have still a further discovery of these friendly dispositions;
for he is introduced debating with himself whether he should discover
to Menedemus that his son was returned: and though he knows the
young man is unwilling he should, yet resolves upon it, because
it is necessary to the quiet of his friend, and will do Clinia no real
hurt. In the progress of the scene, his friendship appears still more.
He had entertained Bacchis the evening before, under a notion that
she was Clinia's mistress. Her expensive habits alarmed him, as
foreseeing that Menedemus’s fortune would soon be consumed, if care
was not taken to prevent it. These thoughts possessed him so much, ·
that he could not even sleep, but spent the whole night in contriving
what would be the most expedient course for his friend to follow. Fun
of these cares, he rises very early, and knocks at his neighbour’s gate,
resolved to inform him of all he knows, and offer him his advice.

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.

,Α Scaliger (in his Poetics) and Madame Dacier contend, that this
comedy was exhibited in separate parts, and at different times: the
first two acts in the evening‚ after sun-set, and the last three next
morning, at day-break. The interval between the second and third
acts is filled up by the supper, which Chremes gives his guests on that
night of mirth and festivity. See Excunsus V.
