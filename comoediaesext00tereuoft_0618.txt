Eurmcrws, iii. 5. 4l.—Venisse clanculum per impluvium, &c-

A great feature in the ancient house, as distinguished from the
modern, was the internal court, atrium cavaedz'um. It was usually
surrounded with apartments, which, lighted from within, at first sight
seem to have afforded little possibility of the domestic concerns of the
family being overlooked by any one not included within the walls. But
this was an advantage they did not really possess, as we may conclude
from Plautus, Mil. Gil. ii. 3. 16. Seneca also speaks of the annoy—
ance the neighbours were subject to from the disorderly luxury of late
revellers. Gell’s Pompeiana, Series i. 140.

This court, or cavaedium, contained in its centre a shallow cistern,
nearly square, termed compluvium, formed to receive the rain-water
which fell from the roof3 immediately above which, and corresponding
in size with it, was the impluvium, an opening in the roof for the ad-
niission of light to the rooms arranged around the cumdium, ‘and
through which the water collected from the roos was discharged into
the compluvium, and conveyed thence into other reservoirs for the use
of the family.

The impluvium is directed by Vitruvius to be made not larger than a
third part of the width of the atrium, nor less than a fourth: the length
to be determined by that of the atrium. It was occasionally covered
with purple curtains‚ so as to exclude the strong glare of the sun.
See Pliny, N. H. xix. 1. The compluvium was sometimes a piscina,
and contained fish, as a passage in Petronius proves. In superior
houses it was furnished with a jet d’eau, and surrounded by columns of
marble which supported the roof3 and on one side of it was placed the
altar of the domestic divinity. Gell’s Pomp. Ser. i. and ii.

And here, in our author, Jupiter passes over the neighbouring roofs,
and descends through the impluvium to Dana& thereby avoiding the
men’s apartments, through whose court he must have passed, had he

got into the house from the street. Ibid. Ser. i. 143.

 

EXCURSUS IV.

Hammon Tmouuumvos, i. 1. 17.—Fodere, aut arare, aut aliquid serre.

“ This passage is of much greater consequence than is generally
imagined, towards the understanding of the true intent and management
of this play; for it is material to know what Menedemus is about when
Chremes first accosts him; whether he is at work in the field, or is re-
turning home, loaded with his tools. Two very learned rnen engaged
in a very elaborate disputation upon this subject. If Menedemus is stjll
at work, when Chremes first meets him, Terence would certainly have
been guilty of a very gross impropriety in the conduct of his Comedy:

or, as the scene never changes, Menedemus must necessarily be ever .
