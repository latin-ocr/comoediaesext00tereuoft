better to disclose it.'' Thus Colman, who adds the following note:
“ Nothing can be plainer than these words: yet they have been the
occasion of great perplexity to commentators and translators. Madame
Dacier gives them a sense directly opposite to that which I have fol-
lowed. Ah, qu’ allez vous faire ? Je vous en prie changez de sentiment.
Echard, who keeps his eye more constantly on the French translation
than on the original, says, much to the same purpose : ‘ D' ye think so?
Pray think on’t again.' Cooke has it, ‘ How, let me advise you to
think better of it.' Westerhovius supposes Sostrata to have appeared
angry with Geta, and therefore explains ut melius dicas to signify ut
bona verba loquaris, ‘ that you may speak mildly.’ Patrick justly think-
ing that thisis too strained, and no satisfactory answer to Sostrata; and,
from what follows, seeing the necessity of explaining Geta's answer, so
as to make it imply an assent, supposes an ellipsis3 and supplies it thus:
Accedo tibi, ut qui melius dicas : ‘ Ι submit to you, as you seem to speak
with more justice! All these interpretations are founded on the suppo*-
sition that melius is the accusative governed by dicas. Ι have no doubt
but that melius is here used adverbially, which will lead us to this easy
construction: ‘ I agree, that you may better tell it.' '’ So far Colman.
In a curious old translation by Hoole, lent me by my learned friend
T. A. Beck, Esq. of Esthwaite Lodge, near Hawkeshead, this passage

is thus strangely rendered—r: “ What is that? I come nearer, that you
may better tell me.”
