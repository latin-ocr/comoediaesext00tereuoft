device; he pretends to the old men, that he had conferred with
Phormio, and brought him to consent to take Antipho’s wife home to
himself, provided he has with her a portion of thirty minae. Demipho
immediately gets the money from Chremes, and counts it down to
Phormio, who gives it to Phaedria, and Phaedria to Dorio for his
mistress. These things are no sooner over, than Phanium comes to
be known. This proves matter of great joy to the old men, that a
marriage, which they had before concerted between themselves, should
by chance be concluded-in their absence, and without their knowing
any thing of it. But still they are disturbed‚ that they have parted with
the thirty minae. At first they endeavour to recover it by gentle
methods3 but, finding these ineffectuaI, proceed to threats and violence.
Meantime, Phormio, who had now learned the whole story ofChremes‘
two wives, goes and discovers all to Nausistrata. She, upon this,

complains heavily of her husband, but at length is pacified, and agrees
to leave all to the decision of her son.

The scene is laid at Athens.

I The metre of this Prologue, as well as of all the others, is Trimeter

past perfect tense, but also with a present, as here and in Virg. Ecl. i.

i. e. compel him to abandon his love of verse. —- Et transdere hominem
in otium. ‘⁴ And bury him in indolence.'’ Transdere an ancient form
for tradere. - 3. Ne scribat. Comp. Hec. Prol. ii. 11. -- 4. Quasfecit
fabulas. Comp. Andr. Prol. 3..—— 5. Tenui esse oratione et scriptura
levi. ‘⁴ That the characters are low, and the style mean.'¹ The poet
here, says Donatus, shows the want ofjudgment in the censures of the
critic, who objects to him as a fault, what ought to be the chief ex-
cellence of comic style. It is true, indeed, that Terence was in this
instance held inferior to Menander, and condemned for using less
sublime language than his original: from which censure he here eii—
deavours to vindicate himself by saying, that such a raised style rather
belonged to* the province of tragedy. Madame Dacier also refers
oratio to the “ characters,'' and scriptura to the “style.'’ A com&
mentator on Horace (Epist. ad Pisones) directly contradicts Donatus,
and* says: The sense of this passage is not as commentators have idly
thought, ‘⁴ that his style was low and trifiing‚'' for this c'ould never be
pretended, but “ that his dialogue was insipid; and his characters,
and in general his whole composition, without that comic heightening
which their vitiated tastes required.'’ — 6. Quia nusquam insanum feeit
adulescentulum, διο. “ Because he ne’er described a mad-brained youth,
who, in his fits of phrenzy, thought he saw a hind, the dogs in full
cry after her.’' This verse illustrates the foregoing3 for here the poet
gives us a specimen of his rival’s genius and taste. He was fond of
introducing characters extravagant, unnatural, and overstrained: hence
the language must be of a picce, impetuous, turbulent, full of rant
and affectation. No wonder, therefore, if he could not relish the com-
positions of our poet, whose characters are drawn from nature, and

the language suitably artless and simple. —- 7. Videre. Φαντέζεςθαι-
