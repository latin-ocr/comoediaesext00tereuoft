called by the Greeks, Parechesis. Comp. Juvenal, x. 122.—3. Miror, si. Δ
A Grecism: θαυμάζω, εἴ. Comp. Livy, iii. 213 and see Sturz. Lex. s
Xenoph. —- Si te sibi quisque expetit. “ If every man should wish thee
for his own‚’' i. e. as a wife. The verb expetere is properly used in an
honourable sense. Comp. Andr. iv. 2. 13; Phorm. v. 8. 35. —- 4. Nam
mim, &c. ‘⁴ For your discourse was to me an indication of your dispo-
sition-'³ Ἀνδρὸς χαρακτὴρ ἐκ λόγου γνωρίζεται. Although men of art
and deep designs may sometimes wrap themselves up in disguise, so as
to hide their real purposes3 yet ’tis seldom they are so much upon
their guard, but that now and then their speech betrays them. But
more particularly in characters of innocence and unaffected simplicity,
such as that of Antiphila, their discourse never fails to make a real dis-
covery of their inclinations and temper. —5. In animo considero. Cum
animo cogitare, Adesph. iii. 4. 55, and cum animo reputare, Sall. Jug. c.
13, are used in the same sense.—6. Vostrarum. For vestrum, the
possessive for the primitive, Gr. ὑμῶν. Comp. Eun. iv. 4. 11. -— Volgus.
Supply hominum : “ a multitude of lovers.'' Comp. iii. 1. 38; Hec. iv.
2. 24; Ovid‚ Fast. iv. 865. — Ab se segregant. “ Banish from them·
selves,” i. e. who admit only one suitor, and that an honour-able one.
Comp. Andr. i. 5. 56; Hec. iii. 5. 3ος v. 1. 26 ; v. 2. 23. - 8. Expedit
bonas esse vobis. “ It is your interest to lead a modest life.’' All the
MSS. and editions, prior to Bentley's, have bouus, which reading this “
great critic unnecessarily altered to bonis. The latter, however, is the
more usual construction. See Heinsius on Ovid‚ Epist. xiv. 64. ¹
Whenever lieet, lubet, placet, expedit, and such like impersonals, are
construed with an accusative and an infinitive, the dative of the sub—
stantive may be suppressed‚ and its adjective put in the accusative. Τὴε
complete structure is, vobis expedit vos esse bonas. Comp. Phorm. v. 2.
1. See Duker on Livy, xlii. 36. - Bonas. Comp. ii. 2. 4; Tibull. ii.
4. ’15.-ΝΜ sinunt. Virtue is here commended from the mouth os
one who has renounced it. Bacchis is willing to excuse, in the best
manner she can, the way of life in which she had engaged, and throws
the blame of it upon necessity. This, though the best excuse that can
be offered, is, in reality, but a very frivolous one. —9. Colunt. This
is not so strong a word as amant. Comp. Virg. AEn. iv. 4223 Ovid‚
Art. Am. i. 722. See Burmann on Petron. c. 127. - 10. Alio con-
serunt. Comp. Eun. iii. 1. 60.

11. Nisi prospectum, &c. “ Unless, meantime, we provide for our-
selves.” So Livy, iv. 49. Qui sedem senectuti vestrae prospiciunt.
Comp. Phorm. v. 7. 70. —Desertce vivimus. For deserimur. Comp.
Phorm. v, 1. 24; Cic. ad Div. xiv, 1 ; Catull. x. 33. In such expres—
sions, says Ruhnken, the adjective has the force of an adverb. See
Gronov. on Livy, iii. 50. — 13. Cujus. For quorum. Comp. Eun. ii.
1. 20. -- Vostrum. For vestro mori. —Hz' se ad vos applicant. Comp.
Andr. v. 4. 21.- 14. Hoc beneficio. Supply mutuo. Comp. Cic. ad
Div. xiii. 7. -—- 15. Incidere. This verb, when used for accidere, is
applied to some missortune or calamity. Comp. Cic. Nat. Deor. i. 7 ς
Propert. i. 15. 28; Livy, i. 58. —- 16. Nescio alias. “ Ι know not what
other women may do3 this Ι known that I myself have always made it
my carc, that my own happiness should be dependent on his.’' Comp.
v. 4. 153 Andr. iv. l. 3. Τὰ τῶν ἄλλων ’γυναικῶν μὴ πολυπραγμονῶ.
The character of Antiphila is here finely drawn, and represents inno-
cence in perfectiori. There is nothing of constraint or emulation in
