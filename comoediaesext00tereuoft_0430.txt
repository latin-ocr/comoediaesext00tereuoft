out. To prevent an accident so unlucky for him and Clitipho, he applies
to Clinia, that he will not be so far transported by his good fortune, as
to pursue only what appeared best for himself, without any regard fot
his friend3 but as every thing had now succeeded to his wish, he will
consent to defer his happiness for a day, till what respects Clitipho
shall be put on the right footing. Clinia, for some time abandoned
to the excess of his joy, minds nothing of what Syrus says to him, nor
can he answer any other way than by exclamations on his good fortune.
But at last recollecting himself, he consents, not without some relue-
tance, to what Syrus requests of him.

The first twenty-nine verses of this scene are Tetrameter Iambies
Catalectic. Verse 30 is a Trimeter Iambic. The remaining verses are
Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic.

1. Nulla mihi res, Sco. “ The greatest misfortune, henceffirward, that
can befall me, cannot give me any uneasiness 3 such is my joy, so full
and absolute.’' Similar to this is the exultation of Pamphilus, Andr. V.
5. 4. — 3. Dedo patri me. Comp. Andr. i. 1. 36 ; Eun. v. 8. 9. -
Frugalior‚ &a ‘⁴ More temperate than even he can wish.'' —4. Nil
me fefellit. [Syrus overhearing.] “ Ι am not deceived : the girl is
acknowledged to be Chremes' daughter.” -—- 5. Istuc. [To Clinia] —
6. Quidni ? Comp. v. 1. 34. What Syrus tells Clinia, observes
Madame Dacier, that he “ was present all the while‚'' makes it probable
that he went in along with Chremes and Sostrata, and that, of conse-
quence, there the third act ends. To this may be objected what syrus
says in the fourth verse of this scene:

Nil me fefellit .· coynita est, quantum audio hujus verba.

For any one may readily say, that as Syrus knew not of Antiphila’s
being discovered to be Chremes’ daughter, but “ by what he overheard
Clinia say‚'‘ this is a clear sign he was not personally present at the dis-
covery. But this difficulty, she adds, may be easily obviated. Syrus
enters with Chremes and Sostrata; he hears what Antiphila says to
them ; and seeing how it is likely to be, and the disasters that threaten
himself, he has not patience to wait the end, but runs out to think of
his missortune, and, if possible, to contrive some method to prevent
it. —- 7. Cuiquam. Comp. Andr. iv. 1. 2; iv. 3. l. — Commode. Comp.
Hec. i. 2. 33 ; Plaut. capt. iii. 5. 42. — 9. Quam illius. “ As on Antie
phila's account.'‘

10. Ita credo. A formula of politely assenting to any thing. Comp.
Andr. v. 4. 36.——Da te milli vicissim. “ Give me a moment’s hearing
in my turn.” Comp. Adelph. v. 3. 52 ; Cic. ad Div. ii. 8 ; and see Heins.
on Ovid, Epist. xvi. 16. — 11. Amici res, est videndum, διο. “ Your
friend Clitipho's business must be attended to.'' — 12. Ne quid de
amica nunc senex. Supply sciat. “ That Chremes may not make any
discovery with regard to Bacchis.” —- O Jupiter. We have here a
beautiful soene of the joy of Clinia on the one hand, and the anxiety of
Syrus on the other. Each speaks agreeably to his character and cir-
cumstanees. It would have been preposterous to suppose that Clinia,
in so great a fiow of joy, could attend to any thing but his present good
fortune. It must be importunity and repeated entreaties in Syrus, that
will bring him to hearken to what he says. — 13. Nubet mihi. Comp.
