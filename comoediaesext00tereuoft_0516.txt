ACT I. Scmm 1.

The poet here, as in all his other plays, begins with letting us into
as much of the plot as is necessary for understanding the several inci-
dents and characters, according to the order in which they are to appear.
Pamphilus was so greatly attached to a courtezan named Bacchis, that
he had made a promise never to marry while she lived. Philotis,
another courtezan, who used to make one at their merry meetings‚
was no stranger to this. Being under the necessity some time after
of going to Corinth, she is surprised at her return to hear that Pamphi-
lus, notwithstanding his promise, is actually married. This breach
of saith makes the subject of her conversation with Syra in the pre-
sent scene. The latter takes occasion hence to give her some instruc-
tions with regard to the management of men, that since they were for

the most part selfish and mercenary, she ought to show no mercy, but
make the most of them. “

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.
