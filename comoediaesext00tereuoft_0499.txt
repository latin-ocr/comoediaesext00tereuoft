lies in the word comissator, which signifies a person who, after having
been already ,engaged in one revel, goes masked to another, and enters
suddenly, with much noise and clamour. The word is, therefore, very
happily applied to Demea, who rushes suddenly into Micio’s house,
where they are revelling, and raises a great disturbance. —- 9. Quid ego

ACT V. ScENE ΙΙΙ.

In this scene, Micio is seen coming out from‘Sostrata, aster having given
her what instructions he thought proper relating to the marriage. At
the same time, Demea, who had rushed into his brother’s‚ and there
found Ctesipho revelling with the music-girl, driven almost to distrac-
tion, comes out in a great fury. This naturally begets a conversation
full of anger and passion on one side, full of meekness and good nature
on the other. Micio, finding that his brother is too greatly provoked
by what he had lately discovered, to think of calming him in the usual
way, by appearing unconcerned, resolves to dissemble no longer, but
to lay before him the principles upon which he acted, and the motives
that led him to prefer lenity to rigour. All this he does with so much

{emtpler and good sense, that Demea is at last pacified, and yields to his
ro er.

The metre is Trimeter Iambic.

Ctesipho was concerned with AEschinus, he gives way to passion too
great for expression. He invokes heaven, and earth, and sea, all the s
elements and all the gods, This is agreeable to nature, and the custom
of the best poets. Comp. Virg. Ecl. v. 23 ς Ovid‚ Trist. ii. 53. --
