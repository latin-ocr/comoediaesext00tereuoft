EXCURSUSEs

EXC URSUS Ι.

“ Tm: principa] circumstances necessary to be mentioned, for the
better illustration of these Comedies, are those relative to the repre-
sentation. Some, says Echard‚ object, that in the beginning of many
sceneS, two actors enter the stage, and talk to themselves a considerable
time before they see or know one another; which is neither probable
nor natural.—They that object to this, do not consider the difference
between our small-scanty stage and the large magnificent Roman
theatres. Their stage was sixty yards wide in front3 their scenes so
many streets meeting together, with by-lanes, rows, and alleys; so
that two actors coming down two distinct streets or lanes, could not
be seen by each other, though the spectators might see both3 and
sometimes, if they did see each other, they could not well distinguish
faces at sixty yards’ distance. Besides, on several accounts, it might
well be supposed, when an actor entered the stage, out of some house, he
might take a turn or two under the porticoes, usual at that time, about
his door, and not observe another actor on the other side of the stage.

“ As to the habits of the actors, it is plain from Donatus, as well as
the reason of the thing, that they were in general suited, according to
the custom of the times and country, to the sex, age, and condition of
the several characters. Some particulam, however, in their dress very
essentially distinguish the ancient players from those on any modern
stage, viz. the buskin, the sock, and the mask. The buskin was a
kind of high-heeled boot, worn only by the tragedians; as the sock
was a kind of sandal peculial· to the actors in comedy. Every player
wore amask, which enclosed the whole head, and had false hair fastened
to it, agreeable to the visage and complexion of the forepart. The
mask was called persona, from personare, “ to sound through,” being
so formed as to enlarge the voice, and convey it to a great distance;
a contrivance which the vast extent of the ancient theatres rendered
extremely necessary. For the same reasons the features portrayed
on the vizor were so much aggravated beyond the proportion of those
drawn by the hand of nature. It must be confessed, that in these
instances the moderns have infinitely the advantage ; and that, by con· ¹
tracting the dimensions of their theatres, although they have a good
deal abated the magnificence os the spectacle, they have been able to
