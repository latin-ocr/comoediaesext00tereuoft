Pamphila.” — Illas. Pamphila and her mother. — Sed me reprehendi.
‘⁶ Yet Ι restrained myself.” Some MSS. have repressi, which Bentley
approved of. This, however, is a mere gloss on reprehendi. Comp.
Heaut. i. 2. 25: Ovid, Epist. xi. 53. AEschinus here gives a very
great proof of his discretion. When any thing alarms us suddenly, or
we see ourselves injured in the opinion of one we have a value sor, it
is the hardest matter in the world to check the impatience we feel of
being justified; nor are we apt, in such a case, to regard the con-
sequence. But AEschinus, however anxious he was to remove his
Pamphila’s suspicions, is yet too discreet to do it at the hazard of his
brother's repose.— 17. Ac fieret palam. “And lest by her the
knowledge of it might be made public.’' Ne is to be supplied here
from the foregoing clause. Comp. Heaut. iv. 3. 43 ; Ovid, Epistsii. 81. .
-- 18. Quod minime ’st opus usquam efferri. “Which of ail things
should by no means be revealed.'’ — 19. Ac mitto. Supply hunc
timorem. He would say nothing of his brother's affair to the nurse, as
knowing her prating humour, and that it would be soon spread all over
the town. But now that she is gone, he is considering in his own mind
how he shall clear himself to Pamphila and her mother. shall Ι tell
them that the girl was for my brother? a story that I am veryunwilling
should be known. However, I dismiss that sear: ’tis possible, for
their own sakes, they may be discreet enough to keep it secret: but I
doubt whether they would believe me: there are so many eircum-
stances that make it likely the girl was for myselss that my telling
them she was for my brother, may appear a mere temporary shiflx-r-
Ut ne qua exeat. ‘⁴ That it may not by any means spread abroad.”
Qua for aliqua ratione. A report is properly said exire. Comp. ii.
4. 19; Nepos, Dat. c. 6.—-20. Metuo ut credant.' “I sear they* will
not believe it.’' Comp. Andr. v. 4. 11. —Tot concurrunt. Comp.
Heaut. ii. 2. 3.

22. Haec adeo. ‘⁴ These truly.’' — Non me, &c. “ Ought I n'otrto‘
have declared this affair, such as it is, to my father?'' Comp. iii.
3. 54. -23. Ut eam ducerem. Comp. iii. 2. 34. -24. Cessatum m “
adhuc est, &a “What indolence even till this hour! Now stom ⁸
instant rouse thyself.” Porro is opposed to usque adhuc. Comp. iii.
2. 37. By expergiscere is meant that he must now rouse from a
state of indolence and sloth3 for so the word is often used, where an
exertion of vigour and industry is intended. Comp. Sall. Cat. c. 20; 52.
.— 25. Ad illas ibo. Comp. Heaut. ii. 3. 99. —- 27. Aperite aliquis.
Aliquis here is a partitive, that is, a word signifying many severally,
or one by one. Hence though it is here in the singular, it has all the
force of the plural. Comp. Eun. Prol. 1 ; Plaut. Pseud. v. l. 37.

We have seen that Micio had gone along with Hegio to Sostrata, to
remove her suspicions with regard to AEschinus ; and at the same time
make her sensible that she had nothing to apprehend from him, who
would be so far from opposing the marriage, that he would further it
all in his power. Meantime AEschinus, infor-med of Sostrata’s sus-
