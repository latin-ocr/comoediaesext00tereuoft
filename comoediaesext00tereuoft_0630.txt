made in the most uninteresting manner, by a long soliloquy in the
third act; and the catastrophe itself is managed iu the same cold
manner, by another long soliloquy3 the incidents that shouldlmve
filled the fifth act, being injudiciously precluded by what is supposed
to pass in the preceding interval.-In point of character, also, the
Hecyra has much, less merit than the rest of our author’s picces.
Laches and Phidippus are far inferior to Simo, Menedemus‚.chremes‚
Micio, Demea; nor is Pamphilus equal to the Pamphilus in the
Andria, or Phaedria, or AEschinus‚ &c. This play has been, by some
critics, coupled with the Heauton Timorumenos, for purity of style and
beauty of sentiment. Itis not void of those graces, no more than it:
is wholly destitute of art in the construction of the plot3 but surely it ’
possesses them in a much less eminent degree than the Heauton Timo-
rumenos. Can the narration of Parmeno, not to dwell on its being
needless, be compared with that of Menedemus ; or with that of Simo
in the Andria, or that of Geta in the Phormio ,7- Ι have endeavoured
to omit no opportunity of taking notice of the beautiful passages of
this play; and I have indeed been more than ordinarily assiduous to
point them out, in order to show, that in the most indifferent pro-
ductions of a great author, there are many things worthy our attention
and imitation. On the whole, however, I am sorry to be obliged to differ
once more from the learned and ingenious critic above-cited: and I
cannot help thinking it rather singular, that he, who everywhere main-
tains that character is the chief object of comedy‚ should yet seem to
draw conclusions directly opposite to these premises3 and not only
prefer Terence, whose artificia] fables rendered him popular, to all
other comic drmnatists, but also rank the Hecyra, merely'on account
of the ‘nice dependency and coherence of the fable‚’ higher in merit
than any other of his pieces, confessedly more 'rich in character. I
must own that, so far from being able to acquiesce in the opinion,
that ‘it is indisputably, to every reader of true taste, the most
masterly and exquisite of the whole collection: 1 am, in this in·-
stance, much rather inclined to say with Volcatius,

Snmetar Hecyra sexta ex iis fabula.
‘ The last, and least in merit of the sixte-Cotum.
