ACT II. Scene I.

We have observed in the preceding scene, that Demea had been
informed ofAEschinus’s coming into Sannio’s house, and taking thence
by force a music-girl. As this scene, therefore, seems to contain a
representation of that scuffie, it may appear to the reader preposterous,
and contrary to the order of time. To obviate this difficulty, we are to
observe, that AEschinus had no less than two quarrels with Sannio. The
first, when he broke into his house and carried off the music-girl. As
this could not be done without a great deal of noise, and gathering a
crowd of people about the door, the rumour of it flew all over the town,
and instantly reached Demea. He runs to his brother Micio, to com-
plain, and reproach him with it. This is what we have observed in the
last scene. Meantime, AEschinus, bringing home the music-girl, is
followed by Sannio, who persecutes him all the way, till he comes to
Micio's door; and endeavours to hinder him from conveying her into
the house, which gives rise to another squabble. This is evident fl‘om
the-circumstances of the story itself t for Sannio, speaking of the former
assault, says, vs. 44, Domo me eripuit, verberavit : me invito abduxit
meam : Homini misero plus quingentos colaphos infregit mihi. Whereas,
in this latter quarrel, AEsehinus says to his servant, vs. 13, Abi prae
strenue ; acforem aperi. And afterwards, I intro nunc jam.

Of this scene, verses 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 11, are Tetrameter Trochaics Aca-
talectic; and verses 7, 9, 10, 12-16, 43-54, Tetrameter Trochaics
Catalectic. Verse 4 may be scanned as a Dimeter Iambic; though
Reinhardt makes it a Dimeter Trochaic Catalectic, by shortening the·
first syllable of istum. Verses 5, 17——42‚ are Tetrameter Iambics
Acatalectic. The last syllable of vs. 11 is carried to the beginning of
vs. 12. Comp. ii. 2. 9.
