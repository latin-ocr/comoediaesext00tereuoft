yourself.” Ebrius does not always imply drunkenness. Comp. Plau&
Capt. i. 1. 35. —4. Noster socer, video. [Laches to Bacchis] The verb
video, like scio, is veryfrequently put absolutely.— 5. Dejerat persancte.
‘¹ Swears most solemnly.'’ Donatus remarks : Si correpte, dejerat,
Deos jurat .· si producte, dejerat, valde jurat.—6. Neque has respicereDeot
opinor. These words, which are of ambiguous import, insinuate that
Bacchis, and persons of her calling, have little regard for the sanetity of
an oath. They may be translated: “ And I do not imagine they have any
reverence for the gods ;” or, ‘⁴ And I do not believe the gods have any
regard for them.'’ The latter bids fairest for the poet’s meaning, as it
expresses a greater contempt for those wretches, and forms a kind of
contrast to the former partos the sentence. The difference of character
between Laches and Phidippus is worthy of remark. It was fit that
the father of the wife should appear more passionately enraged against
the courtezan, than the father of the husband. The poet in this show·
his perfect knowledge of nature and the human passions.

7. Ancillas dedo. “ I surrender my waiting-women to your exami-
nation.” —- Per me. ‘⁶ With my permission.” -—- 8. Haec res hic agitur.

The present for the future: “I shall not reg-ret the fame of having
done, what others of my calling would avoid ;'' i. e. I shall deem it suf-
ficient fame, διο. Terence, says Donatus, by his uncommon art, has
attempted many innovations, with great success. In vthis comedy he
introduces, contrary to received prejudices‚ a good mother-in-law, and
an honest courtezan3 but at the same time, he so carefully assigna
their motives of action, that by him alone every thing seems recon-
cilable to truth and nature: for this is just the opposite of what he
mentions in another place (Eun. Prol. vs. 37) as the common privilege
of all poets, Bonas matronas facere, meretrices malas.

11. Mulieres. For uxores. The word suspectas is equivocal, be·
cause it may be considered as either active or passive, and, therefore,
renders the passage capable of a twofold interpretation. For it may
either mean ε “ Our wives have entertained unjust suspicions with
regard to Pamphilus;” or, “We have unjustly suspected our wives
in this affair.” The latter interpretation seems preferable: and it
seems to be confirmed by the word nobis, which cannot easily be
seconciled with the other mode of explaining the passage. - 12. Hanc
nunc experiamur. “ Let us now avail ourselves of the assistance of
Bacchis.” Comp. Plaut. Merc. iv. 4. 29. - 13. Nam si compererit
crimini, διο. “ Foris your wife shall find that she gave creditto a
groundless charge,'' &c. Crimen is osten put for criminatio. See
Drakenb. on Livy, vi. 15. 7. Many manuscripts and printed copies
have the word falso after ωπον, but this destroys the metre; besides, the
idea conveyed by falso is implied in crimen itself. Crimen falsa insimu-
latio est, says Donatus. - 14. Sin autem. See Hermann, Elem. D. M.
p. 99. —— Ob eam rem. For the following reason, i. e. quod peperit, &ca

mann, Elem. D. M. p. lOl.——An quia, διο. “ Have I not already
told you my mind on this subject?” — 19. Illis modo explete animum.
“ Do only satisfy their minds.”
