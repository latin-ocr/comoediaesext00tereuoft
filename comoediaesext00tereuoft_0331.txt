PLo'r or THE Eunucnns.

A certain citizen of Athens had a daughter, whose name was
Pamphila, and a son called Chremes. Pamphila, while yet an infant,
was carried off from Sunium by a band of robbers, who sold her to a
Rhodian merchant. He, carrying her to Rhodes, made a present of
her to a courtezan‚ with whom he was at that· time much in love. She
having received the girl, brought her up with the same care and tender-
ness as her own daughter Thais, insomuch that every body considered
them as real sistcrs. Thais, who was somewhat older, on coming of
age, removed to Athens in company with a stranger, who, dying shortly
after, left her his heiress. Mean time a captain, by name Thraso, falls
in love with Thais, and, after having lived with her a short time, went
on a visit to Caria. During this period Thais's mother-died, and her
brother exposed Pamphila to public sale, hoping, that as she was very
beautiful, and perfectly skilled in music, he might dispose of her to
advantage. It happened at that time the captain was at Rhodes, and
knowing nothing of what we have just related, he bought her, that he
might present her to Thais on his return to Athens. Thais, after the
departure of the captain, had aimed at securing another lover, named
Phaedria, an Athenian youth, the son of Laches. She had, moreover,
got some hints with regard to Pamphila, and having conversed several
times with Chremes, imagined she had pretty good reasons to believe
that the girl, who had been educated with her at home, was that young
man’s sister. She therefore earnestly desired that. she might have it
in her power to restore Pamphila to her relations, and by that means
do a good office to the girl, and at the same time secure the patronage
of her relations. The captain returns, but hearing of Thais’s engage-
ments with Phaedria, resolves not to present her with the girl, unless
his rival is first discarded. Thais, who loved Phaedria from her soul, is
at a loss what course to pursue; but hoping that she might easily justify
her conduct to Phaedria, to please the captain she exeluded him. N ext
day sending for Phaedria, who was greatly offended at her behaviour,
she endeavours to clear herself, and, aster many entreaties, prevails
with him to let Thraso seemingly have the preference, for the space
only of two days 3 assuring him that as soon as she was inv possession
of the girl she would throw him off altogether. Phaedria, that he
might bear these two days’ absence with less regret, resolves to go
into the country, and recommends Parmeno to carry to Thais the
Eunuch and Ethiopian girl, whom he had bought for her. Mean time
as Pamphila is being conducted from Thraso's house to Thais, she
is accidentally seen by Chaerea, Phaedria’s younger brother, who is
so violently smitten with her that he is ready to run any risk in
order to obtain her ς and cannot be at ease till he prevails on
Parmeno to lead him to the house of Thais in the Eunuch’s
dress. To conclude, Thais having gone to supper to the captain's
house, Chaerea in the mean time succeeds with Pamphila. This
