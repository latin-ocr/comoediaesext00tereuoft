pror. 355

you will be able to support the expense, if you have her constantly to
furnish out in all her follies. What I would have you do, is this:
receive your son kindly and frankly, but conceal the knowledge of
,this his weakness 3 and if he endeavours at any time, by little artifices,
to have wherewith to supply his mistress, suffer yourself to be deceived3
for this will be a sure way of retaining him with you, and also be less
expensive to yourself. This was Chremes’ advice, not aware that he
was clear enough abroad, but was blind at home. Syrus was, in the
mean time, hatching a project how he might cozen Chremes out of ten
minae, which he had promised to obtain for Bacchis. As he is busy in
‚contriving with himself, Chremes takes him aside, and addressing him
with an air of kindness, encourages him to think of some project
against Menedemus. Syrus whispers to him a story which he had in-
vented to serve the present turn, that an old woman of Corinth, the
mother :of Antiphila, (for so she was reputed to be‚) had borrowed a
thousand drachmae from Bacchis, and that she being since dead, the
girl was left as a pledge for the money. While these things are doing,
Sostrata happened to know her ring, and by that means came to dis·
*cover that Antiphila was her daughter. Transported with joy, she
relates all to her husband, who, though he pretends to chide her, is yet
himself highly pleased at recovering his daughter. And now every
thing had been quiet but for Bacchis. Ten minae were to be got for
her, by any means, and there was some danger too, lest Chremes might
find out that she was his son's mistress. To prevent this, the dal-ing(
Syrus forms a project of discovering to both the old men, the matter
as it really is, and, at the same time, fairly extricate himself from so
perplexed and entangled a business. First‚ therefore, says he to
Chremes, I have found a way of obtaining the money from Menedemus.
Let us pretend that this Bacchis is your son Clitipho’s mistress, and
beg that he will suffer her to be a few days at his house, and conceal it
from you. Besides, Clinia shall pretend that he is fallen deeply in
love with your daughter, lately discovered, and beg her sor a wife.
What then? why, he will ask money from his father, to buy ornaments
for the wedding, and then will give the money to Bacchis. By this
means, Bacchis, by the advice of Syrus, had passed over to Menedemus,
,and carried her whole train along with her. Chremes did not, at first,
approve of this project3 but, says Syrus, you cannot honourably avoid
aying down the money, for which your daughter was given in pledge.
,· ell, says Chremes, I will pay it, and contentedly too. Give it, then,
resumes Syrus, to Clitipho, and let him carry it to Bacchis3 for, by
this means, Menedemus will the more easily be deceived into the
belief that she is his mistress. Let it be so, then, replies Chremes;
and immediately counts down the money to Clitiph0‚ that he may
,carry it to Bacchis. Meantime, the whole plot is discovered. Chremes
rag-ing, and full of indignation, threatens to make severe examples of
them. At length, after giving his consent to the match of Clinia with
Antiphila, sostened partly by the intercession of Menedemus, partly by
the entreaties of his wife, he forgives them. Clitipho promises that he
will abandon all courtezans, and marry. This is remarkable here:
-though in other plays, the plot exhibited takes up no more than one
day, yet in this we are under the necessity of supposing two days taken
up in the representation.
The scene is laid in a village near Athens.
