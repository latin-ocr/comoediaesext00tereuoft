discovery concerning Philumena 3 but that she had retired home
merely for the purposegoflying—im is a fact which it would not be in hisv
power to conceal. In regard to Laches, Phidippus, and Sostrata, this
fact indeed is of no consequence: but Parmeno, who had been en-
trusted with his master’s former secrets, must either conclude the child
to be no son of Pamphilus, or guess at the real state of the case. Either
way the intention of the poet is defeated : and what is still worse than
even Parmeno’s being acquainted with it himself, we know that he had
communicated it to a couple of courtezans; so that this mystery is
indeed likely to be what the French call le secret de la comedie, though
not in the sense that Terence himself proposed. —- 52. Clamorem.

ACT III. Scnm: IV.

Pamphilus, we have seen, had sent Parmeno to assist Sosia and the
other servants, in carrying home his baggage from the ship. They
accordingly appear now; and the poet very naturally supposes, that
Sosia had been entertaining Parmeno with the particulars of their
voyage, which conversation is continued in the beginning of this scene.
Pamphilus, in the mean time, who had promised to conceal Philumena’s
misfortune, and is, therefore, anxious to remove Parmeno out of the
way, lest he might overhear her eries, contrives to dispatch him to the
Acropolis‚ under pretence of an appointment he had made with his
Myconian host.

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.
