probability in the catastrophe of the Adelphz' .· it is not in nature, that a
morose, severe, covetous old fellow of sixty should become all at once
gay, complaisant, and liberal. The catastrophe of L'Ecole des Maris
is the best of all the pieces of Moliere. It is probable‚ natural,
grounded on the plot; and, what is of full as much consequence, ex-
tremely comic. The style of Terence is pure and sententious, but a
little cold, as Caesar, who excelled in all, has reproached him. The
style of Moliere in this piece is more chaste than in any of his others.
The French author almost equals the purity of the diction of Terence ;
and goes far beyond him in the intrigue, the character, the catastrophe,
and humour.’'—VOLTA1RE, Contes de Guillaume Vade.

“ It is impossible for any reader‚ who is come fresh from the perusal
of the Adelphi of Terence, and L'Ecole des Maris of Moliere, to ac-
quiesce in the above decision; and Ι would venture to appeal from
Voltaire to any member of the French Academy‚ for a reversa] of it.
The reputation of Moliere has'g taken too deep root to be rendered
more flourishing by blasting that of Terence; nor can such an attempt
ever be made with a worse grace, than when the imitation is blindly
preferred to the original. Moliere, so far from having taken only the
idea of his piece from the Adelphi, has translated some passages
almost literally3 and the latter part of the second scene of L' Ecole
des Maris is a very close imitation of one in the fourth act of the
Ade hi.

(βίη point of fable, Ι make no scruple to prefer the comedy of
Terence to that of Moliere. The intrigue of the first four acts of
the Adelphi is more artfully conducted than that of any other of
Terence's pieces. In the Andria, were all the episode of Charinus to
be omitted, the play would be the better for it. In the Eunuchus, there
is a lameness in the catastrophe, and the conclusion of Thraso’s
business in the last scene becomes episodical. In the Heauton Timo-
rumenos, the intrigue in a manner ends with the third act. In the
Phormio, the loves of Antipho and Phaedria have no further relation to
each other, than that Phormio is used as an engine in both. But in
the play before us, the interest which AEschinus takes in Ctesipho’s
affairs, combines their several amours so naturally, that they recipro-
cally put each other in motion.

“I cannot think the fable of L’Ecole des Maris quite so happy.

’ In Terence we see a good—humoured uncle adopting one of his nephews‚
while the other lad remains under the tuition of the severe father.
This is natural enough; but in Moliere we have two young women
lest, by their father’s will, as the intended wives of their antiquated
guardians. Is there not some absurdity in such an idea Τ Micio and ·
Demea are confessedly the archetypes of Ariste and Sganarelle ; but,
in my mind, infinitely superior, and exhibited in a greater variety of
situations; nor do the two sisters, Isabelle and Leon0r‚ play into each
other’s hands like AEschinus and Ctesipho. In the Adelphi, the business
and the play open together3 in Moliere the first scene is a mere con—
versation-piece. In Moliere the plot is thin, and seems to have been
calculated for the intrigue of a petite piace, and the circumstance of
Isabelle's embracing Sganarelle, and giving her hand to Valere, is
purely farcical. In Terence the fable is more important, and the inci·
dents naturally unfold themselves one after another3 and the manner
in which Demea gradually arrives at the knowledge of them is ex-
