xvi METRES or TERENCE.

ΙΙΙ. The Dimeter Iambic Cataletic, consisting of two metres, but
wanting the final syllable ; as :

Aggrediar. Bacchis, εᾶῑυέ, Hec. v. 1. 5.

IV. The Trimeter Iambic, called by the Latins Senarian, and con-
sisting of three complete metres3 as:

Tanti-cm lderEm cdpe‘re ὃό ta‘ZEm filiam ?

V. The Tetrameter Iambic Acatalectic‚ otherwise called the Octo·
narian Iambic‚ consisting of four complete metres3 as t

Dz’im tempas ad ἔᾶηι rem imit, sivi (inimum iit ἒκρῖἒνέἰ siizim.

VI. The Tetrameter Iambic Catalectic‚ i. e. the Octonarian Iambic

wanting one syllable. It is also called Septenarian, from containing
seven complete feet; as :

A-rz pffin‘ltebatflcigiti‚ te αἴιοέόνὲ quodfhcisset ,⁹

Note. In measuring Iambics and Trochaics, a mette consists οι
two feet. A verse is said to be Acatalectic when it contains the proper
number of syllables ; and Catalectic when it wants the final syllable.

The following is the Scale for the Tragic Trimeter Iambic :

 

 

υ- υ- υ- υ- *υ- υ-

-- -— —— υυ
*uuna υυυ uun) υυυ *uuo

-υυ -υυ *-·υυ

υυ- *υυ- ψυ-

 

 

 

 

 

The Feet marked with an asterisk in this scale are rare in the
tragedies of Seneca. Only nine examples of an Iambus in the fifth
place occur3 one in the Medea, one in the OEdipus, three in the Her-
cules OEt.‚ two in the leyestes‚ and two in the Troas. A single example
cannot be found in the other five plays. He uses the Spondee and the
Anapest most frequently in this place.

A Tribrach in the first place occurs in twenty-one of the verses of
Seneca: and only twenty-one of his verses exhibit an Anapest in the
third place. He has left us five examples of a Dactyl in the fisth.
Seneca never uses the Tribrach in the fifth.

The Caesura in the Iambic verse occurs generally after the fifth
semifoot, as in these lines from Ausonius :

Iambe Parthis, — et Cz'donum spiculis,
Iambe pennis — alitum velocior,

Padi ruentis — impetu torrentior,
Magni sonora -- grandinis vi densior,
Flammis corrasci —fulminis vibratior.

The Caesura is somewhat more diversified in these lines from Catullus,
Carm. iv. :

Phaselus ille, quem videtis, hospites,
Ait faisse navium celerrimus,

Neque ullius natantis impetum trabis
Nequisse praeterire, sive palmulis
