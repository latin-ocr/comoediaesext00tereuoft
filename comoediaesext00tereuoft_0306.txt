ἰι The priests were obliged, therefore, to hold it during the sacrifice, for

ξ if they set it down the water would be spilled ; besides, setting it down

³ was accounted a profanation. — 4. Ego pretium. “ I am justly

o punished for my folly.” Pretium is sometimes put for poena. Comp.

ι Athenians‚ who in case of a person convicted of a capital crime, never

3 at first condemned him to any express punishment, until they had put

» the question to himself, what he thought he deserved. Such convieted ,Α
persons, in order to excite compassion, often condemned themselves to ⁵
a severer punishment than they deserved, and by this means were
sometimes wholly acquitted. Aristophanes has a passage exactly the

⁴ same as this in the Frogs, vs. 1044, (ἰν. 2. 7.) 1010, Bek. Aa. Τί raedh,
