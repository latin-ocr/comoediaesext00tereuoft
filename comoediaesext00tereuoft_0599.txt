ACT V. Scene ΙΙΙ.

Demipho had gone to Nausistrata, with the request, that she would
go and reconcile Phanium to the match with Phormio. In consequence
of this, they are seen here coming out together, and Demipho is urging

hastening to prevent the money being given away; but finding that
done already, urges Demipho to think no more of separating Antipho
and his new bride. Hence a very pleasant conversation arises; while
Chremes on the one hand is endeavouring to make his brother under·

as you did lately with your purse.'' This alludes to the money bor-
rowed from her to pay Phormio (iv. 3. 76); and, as Donatus observes
