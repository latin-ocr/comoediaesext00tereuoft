had consented to assume an air of good humour, finding it vain to do
otherwise, and partly moved by the reasoning of his brother. But, as
characters change slowly‚ and with great difficulty, Terence represents
this humour as retaining still a tincture of savage rusticity. If he con-
sents to stay in town to-day, to celebrate his son’s wedding, he resolves
to depart with his other son early next morning: and, if he takes the
music-girl with him, it is not so much out of complaisance to his son,
as to render her, in a little time, an object of his disgust. ——- 57. Pugna-

ACT V. Semi: IV.x

This scene sets before us a very uncommon example ; that of an old
man rejecting his former rigid course of life, and embracing one more
complaisant, polite, and fashionable. The poet has taken great care to
prepare for this change, that it may not appear capricious or ridiculous,
which would have but ill suited the character of the person on whom it
is wrought. Demea has‚}through the course of the play, met with many
mortifications. His passion, complaints, advice, are all slighted3 his
brother is loved and followed, himself shunned: besides, the conversa·
tion he had lately held with Micio, was conceived in a strain that must
affect him. No wonder, therefore, if, when left by himself, he begins to
ruminate and reflect on all this, and resolves to abandon his severity,
because he finds it unavailing. It is not, then, so much through appro-
bation that hc assumes a different behaviour, as because heis under
the necessity of doing so. He still thinks fathers ought to be severe in
checking the misconduct of their children; but that it is a temper
odious to youth, and apt to lessen filial affection.

This scene consists of Tetrameter Trochaics catalectic.

1. Nunquam ita quisquam, διο. This scene, says Colman, which I
have placed the first of the fifth act, stands in Madame Dacier’s trans-
lation, and in all those editions and translations which have followed
her, as the second. I think it is plain, from the end of the foregoing
scene, that Micio and Demea quitted the stage and entered the house
together; and it seems to be equally evident‚ from the message that
Syrus brings to Demea in the scene immediately succeeding this, that
Demea had left the company within: Rogat frater, ne abeas longius.
But what had still more weight with me, and was a more forcible motive
to induce me to begin the fifth act with this soliloquy, was the propriety,
and indeed necessity, of an interval in this place. The total change of
