ΗΕΑυΤοΝ TIMORUMENOS, v. 5. 22.—Perplacet. &a

‘⁴ Terence's comedy of the Heauton Timorumenos is, from the begin-

ning to the end, a perfect picture of human life ς but Ι did not observe ,

in the whole one passage that could raise a laugh.”—Spectator, No. 502.

“ The idea of this drama (meaning comedy) is much enlarged beyond
what it was in Aristotle’s time, who defines it to be ‘an imitation of
light and trivial actions,⁷ provoking ridicule. His notion was taken
from the state and practice of the Athenian stage ς that is, from the old
or middle comedy, which answers to this description. The great revoq
lution‚ which the introduction of the new comedy made in the drama,
did not happen till afterwards. This proposed for its object, in general,
the actions and characters of ordinary life; which are not, of necessity,
ridiculous, but, as appears to every observer, of a mixed kind, serious
as well as ludicrous, and, within their proper sphere of influence, not
unfrequently even important. This kind of imitation, therefore, now
admits the serious; and its scenes, even without the least mixture of
pleasantry, are entirely comic. Though the common run of laughers
in our theatre are so little aware of the extension of this province, that
I should scarcely have hazarded the observation but for the authority
of Terence, who has confessedly very little of the pleasant in his drama.
Nay, one of the most admired of his comedies has the gravity, and, in
some places, the solemnity of tragedy itself.”—-HURD, Dissertation
on *the Drama.

“ Terence, whether impelled by his native humour, or determined by
his truer taste, mixed so little of the ridiculous in his comedy‚ as plainly
shows it might, in his opinion, subsist entirely without it.”-Ibid.

⁴‘ In the passages selected stom the ingenious and learned critic last
cited, are these four positions. First‚ that Aristotle, who founded his
notion of comedy on the Margites of Homer, as he did that of tragedy
on the Iliad, had not so enlarged an idea of that kind of drama as we
have at this time, or as was entertained by the authors of the new
comedy. Secondly, that this kind of imitation, even without ‘ the least
mixture of pleasantry,’ is entirely comio. Thirdly, that comedy might,
in the opinion of Terence, ‘ subsist entirely without the ridiculous!
And fourthly, that the Heauton Ttmorumenos has the gravity of tragedy
itself.”

‘⁴ The two first positions concerning Aristotle’s idea of this kind of
imitation, and the genius ofcomedy itself, it is not necessary to examine
at present; and indeed they are questions of too extensive a nature to
be agitated in a fugitive note. But in reg-ard to the two last positions,
with all due deference to the learned critic, I will venture to assert,
that the authority of Terence cannot be fairly pleaded in confirmation
of the doctrine, that comedy may ‘ subsist without the least mixture of
the pleasant or ridiculous-⁹ Terence, says the French critic, fait rire au
dedans, et Plaute au dehors. The humour of Terence is, indeed, of a

‘ more chaste and delicate complexion than that of Plautus, J onson, or

Moliere. There are also, it is true, many grave and affeeting passages
in his plays, which Horace in his rule of

Interdum tamen et vocem Comoedia tollit,
Iratusque Chremes tumido delitigat στω
