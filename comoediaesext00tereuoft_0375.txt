ACT IV. Scmm VII.

This scene gives the most lively representation of the conceited and
ridiculous vanity of the captain, who, calling together his few slaves,
pretends to marshal and draw them up, as if they made a numerous
army, and gives himself all the airs of a general. The poet manages
this part with great address. Thraso says nothing, but what might
naturally be expected from the mouth of such a coxcomb; and yet it is
so contrived, that nothing could have more happily tended to make him
appear ridiculous. He advances with his army, in a hostile manner, to
attack his mistress3 but finding himself vigorously opposed, retires
without effecting any thing3 Gnatho making him believe that, if he
took no notice of her, she would soon return of herself to him in a sup-
pIiant manner.

’ Of this scene, verses 1-17 are Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic ς the
remainder are Tetrameter Trochaies Catalectic.

elegantly used to express indignation. Comp. Andr. i. 5. 28; iii. 5.

Phorm. l. c. thinks postulas, or credis, should be supplied. It appears
that Gnatho, who was much fonder of the bottle than of fighting, was
endeavouring, as they came out, to dissuade Thraso from the contest;

observes here, that the sudden raising of an army, wherein the general
thus addressed the citizens, Qui rempublicam salvam vultis, ΜΕ εΕρωΜῙΝῙ,

who had the command of a hundred men, thought to be of the same
rank as our “ captain.'’ The Roman legion was divided into ten
cohorts, and each cohort into three manipuli, and each manipulus into
three centuries. He who presided over one of the last divisions was
called centurio. —Furum Slaves, as Ruhnken observes, were often
called sures, from their thieving propensity. Comp. Servius on Vix-g.
