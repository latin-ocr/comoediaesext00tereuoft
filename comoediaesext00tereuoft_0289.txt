with Byrrhia, to the house of Chremes, to see if what his master told
him were true or not. Thus having discovered that the marriage
was all mere pretence, he exults, and informs Pamphilus by what signs

Heavens! what news I bring! what joyful news !’' Di boni! is an

rupted by the speech of Charinus, Audin’ tu illum?--6. Quo
intendam. Supply cursum, or ire, from Sall. Jug. c. 107. Hirtius

“You sear this, lest you marry her,” i. e. lest you be compelled to
