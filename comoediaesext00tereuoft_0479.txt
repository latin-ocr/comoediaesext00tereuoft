ACT ΙΙΙ. ΞΟΕΝΕ IV.

· We have seen before, that Geta was despatched by Sostrata, to
acquaint Hegio, their kinsman, of the missortunes that had befallen her
daughter. This he had accordingly done. We see them here coming
along together3 and Hegio appears perfectly astonished at a behaviour
so base and dishonourable. Demea, who, in the former scene, had
spied him, and was resolved to wait his coming up, overhears part of
their conversation; and, as it regards AEschinus, applies it to the story
of the music-girl, which he thought Hegio was shocked at, through his
concern for their family. But upon entering into discourse with him,
he is soon undeceived. Hence, different passions and emotions on both
sides: On the part of Demea, astonishment, anger, and indignation.
He could not easily consent to his son's marrying a woman of no sor-
tune; and he was loth absolutely to reject a demand that had so much
justice on its side, and was urged with such force, by a person of so grave
and weighty a character. In Hegio, we see the manly indignation of
a free spirit, ‘that warmly resents every thing dishonourabie: and though
he addresses a man considerably his superior, yet he speaks with that
boldness and confidence, which a consciousness of having equity on our
side· always inspireS.
This 'scene also consists of Trimeter Iambics.
