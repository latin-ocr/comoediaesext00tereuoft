ACT V. Scene ΙΙ.

At the end of the last scene, Chremes goes in with Sophrona to
Demipho’ s house, to see his daughter. Meanwhile, Demipho and
Geta are employed 1n settling matters with Phormio. This scene opens
with Demipho and Geta returning from Phormio. The old man, who
parted with his money with great regret, shows his discontent m every
thing he says3 while Geta artfully paves the way for the restitution‚
⁷ which in a few days he apprehends will be made.

with respect to fugitive slaves3 who, in making their escape, came not
in sight of their master’s house, but went a great distance out of the
way, rather than pass by it; for ’if they were seen and apprehended, a
much sev erer doom than slavery awaited them. The old man, says
Donatus, complains, that while he was endeavouring to avoid the charge
of being a miser, he had laid himself open to the imputation of being a
fool. —- Many interpret it, “Fly not beyond your own 110115οςη i. e. fly
