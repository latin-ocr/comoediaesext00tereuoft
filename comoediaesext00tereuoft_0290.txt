is taken in the sense of silentium, as in Cic. de Cl. Orat. c. 63. It
may, however, be rendered, in its more usual acceptation, “lone-
liness.”—27. Matrouam nullam. In other words, nullas pronubas.
The pronubae, or “bride-maids,” were of the bride’s friends and
relations, who attended to dress and conduct her to her husband.—-·
