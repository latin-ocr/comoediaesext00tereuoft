continuation of the military allusion. For an army, hard pressed,
regards it as a victory to be able to retreat without loss : and in these
cases it is the general's chief care to cover the flanks and rear, the
greatest danger being from an attack upon them. Ruhnken is also of

These deliberations, as they are here represented, are extremely natural. -
They give us the idea of a man in danger, and greatly perplexed how to
extricate himself and compass his ends. He falls upon several methods

of the money as of a fugitive slave, whom he was in hopes of being still
able to recover. But this allusion in the Greek of Menander, whence
it was taken, must have been far more pointed, because the word χρυσὸς
signifies “ gold,’' and is also the name of a slave, Chrysis. See the

Clinia, by this time, had been informed of all that had happened
and that Antiphila was found to be Chremes' daughter. Nothing
could fall out more happily for him, than that one whom he so entirely
