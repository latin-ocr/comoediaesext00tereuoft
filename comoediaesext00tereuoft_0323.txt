ACT V. SCENE III.

PamphiluS, as he comes out from the house of Glycerium, hearing
himself named, and finding that it is his father, is quite confounded.
Chremes, in this scene, endeavours to moderate Simo's anger, and
bring him to reason. Pamphilus behaves with great submission, and,
unable to stand out against his father's anger, promises an entire
resignation ; but, as he is uneasy at lying under any unjust suspicions,
entreats of his father that he would suffer him to clear himself from the
charge of having suborned Crito. This at last he obtains through the
intercession of Chremes, by which a way is laid open for unravelling
the plot, and discovering th'e parents of Glycerium.

Of this scene vss. 1—24 are Trimeter Iambics ; 25—32, Tetrameter
Trochaics Catalectic.

1. Omnium. Supply nequissime, which Chremes, by interruption,
prevented him from saying.— 2. Rem potius ipsam die, διο. “ Ah,
rather speak at once your purpose, and forbear reproach.’‘ — 3. Gravius.
“‘Too severely.” Comp. Adelph. i. 2. 60; Cic. Verr. iii. 58. —4. Ain’
t'andem, διο. “ And do you say then that Glycerium is a citizen ?” This ἶ
is a formula used in inquiring about any thing which seems wonderful. ᾗ

8. Adeo impotenti esse animo. “ To be so little master of himself.” —
10. Tamen hanc habere, διο. “ To wed himself to shame and this vile ¹
woman.'’ There was a law among the Athenians‚ that no citizen
should marry a stranger; which law also excluded such as were not
born of two citizens from all offices of trust and honour.

¹11. Modone id demum, διο. “ Is it only now at length you feel your
wretchedness?’' — 12. Olim istuc, olim. Madame Dacier observes
justly upon this passage, that it is perfectly fine, and includes a maxim
of the deepest philosophy. Men never think themselves unhappy, till
the disasters, that are the necessary effects of their own foIly, actually
come upon them; whereas, if they were to judge right, they ought to
date themselves unhappy from the very moment that, by their own
choice, they have abandoned themselves to those follies which una-
voidably bring these calamities upon them. — Cum ita animum induxti
tuum. “ When you had so determined in your mind :³¹ “ when you had
made up your mind.'’ The pronoun tuum is unusual in this phrase.
Comp. iii. 3. 40. — 13. Quod cuperes, aliquo pacto efficiundum tibi.
Supply esse.- ‘⁶ To gratify your passion at any rate.'’ — 14. Vere in
te accidit. ‘⁴ Was really applicable to you.’' Inte convenit5 ad te
