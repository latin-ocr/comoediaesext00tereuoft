vi ΗΒΕ or TERENCE.

very justly observes, that had Terence required assistance in the com-
position of his plays, he would not have applied to men younger than
himself, as these certainly were3 but rather would have solicited the
aid of men of maturer talents, as Sulpicius Gallus, δια*

In the thirty-fifth year of his age, and in the height of his popularity,
Terence departed from Rome on a journey to Greece, with the inten-
tion, probably, of studying the Grecian manners and customs on the
spot, in order to be able to give them a more vivid representation in
his future writings for the stage.

Rome never again beheld him. The place and manner of his death
are uncertainly reported ι but it is generally supposed that he was lost
at sea, on his return to Rome, in the thirty-sixth year of his age.
Quintus Consetius† so asserts, adding that he was bringing with him
a great number of comedies translated from Menander, which perished
at the same time. Others state, that he died at Stymphalus in Arcadia,
or at Leucadia, from chagrin and grief for the loss of the above men·
tioned works, and of some originals of his own, composed during his
sojourn in Greece.

He is described as having been of middle stature, slender in person,
and of dark complexion. At the time of his death he possessed some
gardens, of about twenty acres in extent, on the Appian Way, near
Villa Martis. It is strange, therefore, that Porcius Licinius should
write thus, Nil Publius Scipio profuit, διο. as cited in the Life of our
poet, attributed to Suetonius, and inserted here after the Chronology:
which lines are thus rendered by Colman :—

“ Nothing did Publius Scipio‡ profit him,
Nothing did Laelius‚§ nothing Furiusffl
At once the three great patrons of our bard ς
And yet so niggard of their bounties to him,
He had not even wherewithal to hire
A house in Rome, to which a faithful slave
Might bring the tidings of his master's death.”

An only daughter survived him, who was afterwards married to a ¹
Roman knight.

Such is the meagre account that all-devouring time has left us of the
inimitable Publius Terentius.

* The same Sulpicius Gallus who was consul when the Andria was first per-

formed, a friend of the great Africanus, and famous for his knowledge of astro- .

nomy. It was he who foretold the eclipse of the moon, which took ploce on the
evening before the great battle of Pydna. See the Brief Chronoloyu, JA. π. c. 586.

† Of Quintus Consonus, or Confidam or, as it is written in some manuscripts,
Cosconius, nothing is known at present.

‡ Pubtim Scipio AEmilianue, the son of Paulus AEmiliue, afterwards sui-named
Africanus the Younyer.

§ Caius Loelius, who was consul A. U. c. 563, the intimate friend of Publius
Scipio, and the subject of eicero's treatise de Amicitia.

*n Of Publius Furius, or of the author of these verses, Porcius Licinius, scarcely
any memorial has reached our times.
