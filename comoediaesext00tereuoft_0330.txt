EUNUCHUS. Εὐνοῦχος. This play takes its name from .. Dorum
whom Phaedria had purchased for Thais. It seems to have been the ᾗ
most popular os all the comedies of Terence. Suetonius and Donatus ’ἶ
both inform us that it was acted with the greatest applause, and that T
the poet received a larger price for it, from the aediles, than had ever ,
been paid for any play before, viz. eight thousand sesterces, equal to
sixty- -four pounds twelve shillings of our money. ’“
