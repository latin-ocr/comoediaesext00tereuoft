himself, being prevented by the coming of his wife3 nor have any of
the commentators given themselves the trouble to do it for him.
What seems most probable to me is this : he finds that Bacchis makes
a demand of ten minae, and offers Antiphila as a pledge for it; a
bar ain by which >he was sure to lose nothing, and wherein Bacchis
cou d not deceive him, the girl being already in his possession. It is
therefore likely that he intended to advance the money on those
conditions himselfi-The above conjecture of Madame Dacier would
be a very ingenious way of accounting for a man's conduct in these
circumstances in real life; but in a play, where the source of every
action is industriously laid open by the poet, had this been the
intention of Chremes, I should think it would have been expressed,
and the motive that infiuenced him to it also assigned. The following
note of Eugraphius gives a much better account of this conference
between Chremes and Syrus, and shows os how much use it is in the
ensuing part of the sablet—Syrus pretends to have concerted this
plot against Menedemus, in order to trick him out of some money to
be given to Clinia’s supposed mistress. Chremes, however, does not
approve of this; yet it serves to carry on the plot3 for when Antiphila
proves afterwards to be the daughter of Chremes, he necessarily
becomes the debtor of Bacchis, and is obliged to lay down the sum for
which he imagines his daughter had been pledged.

 

ACT IV. SCENE Ι.

This scene makes a very important part of the play, as it contains
the discovery of Antiphila's being Chremes’ daughter. When her
mother gave her to be exposed, she, aISO, according to the superstition
of those times, gave a ring to be exposed with her. The old woman,
who did not comply with her mother's injunctions, but had brought
her up at her own expense, was careful to preserve the ring; and
Antiphila, it seems, after her death, constantly wore it. We have seen
ssiat Terence had separated her from the rest of the company, and
placed her with Sostrata; and when she went to bathe, she gave her
this ring to keep in the mean time. Sostrata, after looking at it with
some attention, knew it again, and immediately ran with it to her
husband. The conversation that ensues upon this is so managed by
the poet as to set both their characters in the strongest light.
Chremes, though apt to be very severe in his remarks upon his wife's

conduct, is yet, in the main, good na{ured, and very ready to forgive 3
