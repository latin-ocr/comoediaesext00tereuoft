ACT II. Semi: Ι.

111 this scene Clitipho is represented as reflecting with himself upon
what his father had said. As young men are apt to repine at every
interruption of their desires, imagine themselves infallible, and cannot
bear restraint, so is the character exactly drawn here. The sentiments
are natural, and the most suitable, to one of Clitipho’s age and dispo-
sition, that can possibly be imagined. He thinks his father behaved
to him without any reasonable allowance for the difference of age3 and
as he had himself lost all relish for the enjoyments of youth, expected
his son should be equally indifferent to them. As he looks upon this
to be very unfair, and believes his inclinations to be no other than what
were natural and excusable at such an age, he falls immediately upon
reflecting how differently he would behave were he a father, and what
allowances he would make for his son. Hence, by an easy transiffion,
ge comes to think of his mistress, and how he might best answer her

emands.

The meter is Tetrameter Iambic Acatalectic.

8. —3. Neque illarum affines, 810. “ And not be propense to,” or
“ participate in, those passions‚” &c. Affines are properly those who
possess lands that border upon one another ; thence the word came to
be extended in signification, and take in not only those who were
united by ties of consanguinity‚ but even such as were “ obnoxious'’
to vices. Affines sceleris, ‘⁸' having a share‚'' or ‘⁴ participation‚ in
crime,'’ is a phrase common in Cicero. — Quas fert adulescentia.
“ Which youth admits of.'’ Comp. Adelph. i. 1. 28. — 4. Ex sua
libidine moderantur. ‘⁴ They govern us according to their own feelings.’'
Westerhovius takes libido here in the sense of voluntas, or arbitrium.
