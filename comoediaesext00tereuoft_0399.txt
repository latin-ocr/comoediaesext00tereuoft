Aer 1. semin 1. 361

17. Aut aliquid facere denique. “ Or, at least, do some other thing.”
Aliquid here is put for aliud quid, as in Ovid, Epist. xii. 80. This
reading is confirmed by Cic. Fin. i. 1. Some editions have aut aliquid
serre denique5 others construe denique with the next line. How are
we to conceive Menedemus employed, says Patrick, when Chremes
addi-esses him? It is most likely he was returning home from labour,
and carrying his instruments of husbandry with him. This is the
more probable‚ because at the end of this, conversation, it appears they
had been all the time within sight of their own houses. In an ancient
MS. mentioned by Madame Dacier, where there are figures at the
beginning of the several soenes, that which fronts this represents
Chremes at a little distance from his house, meeting Menedemus, who
appears to have several instruments of husbandry on his shoulder. —- De-
nique is used in the sense of saltem. —18. Neque te respicis. “ Nor have
you any regard for yourself.” Comp. Plzorm. ii. 3. 87 ; Cic. ad Div. x. 24.
—20. At enim me, διο. “You will perhaps say Ι am vexed that so
little work should be done by my slaves.” Comp. Eun. v. 6. 12.
This is the answer which Chremes supposes Menedemus will make to
justify his own behaviour, and which he therefore here prepares to
obviate. At enim is often used in anticipating objections. See
Tursellin, de Partic. c. 35. Comp. Cic. Phil. ii. 2.—21. Quod in
opere, διο. Constr. Si sumas in servis exercendis illud operoe tuce, quod
consumis in opere, &c. “ If you devote all that time in keeping your
servants to their work, which you spend in labouring yomself, you
will better consult your own advantage.” Emere-ere means “ to keep
at continual labour.” Comp. Adelph. iv. 2. 48 ς Virg. Georg. i. 210.

23. Tantumne ab re tua, &c. “Have you such leisure from your
own affairs to think of those that do not concern you? '' Menander:
*A μὴ προσήκει, μήτ’ ἄκουε, μήτ’ ὅρα.-- 25. Homo sum, &a “ Ι am a
man, and deem all human calamities my own‚” i. e. I feel for all
mankind. These words are an instance how much the sense of any
passage may be mistaken by those who quote it carelessly, and without
consulting the author himself: for nothing is more common, than to
cite these words as expressing how weak human nature is, and ob-
noxious to errors. Whereas it is evident that humanum here means
those misfortunes and distresses which happen to us in life, and which
it is the part of a friend to concern himself in for our consolation.
Comp. Cic. Off. i. 9, and see Ruhnken on Rutil. Lup. ii. 114. We
are informed by St. Augustine‚ Epist. 52, that at the delivery of this
sentiment, the whole theatre, though full of foolish and ignorant
people, resounded with applause.-27.— Rectum ’st? &13- “ Ι ask you,
Is it right? if so, that I may do the same z Is it not right? that I may ,
persuade you from it.” Rectum est? for si rectum est,· and non est ?
for si mm est. Deterrere is sometimes used for dehortari, dissuadere.

28. Mihi sic est usus. ‘⁴ I have need to do so ς do you as you think fit.”
Comp. Hec. iii. 1. 47. —- 30. Si quid laboris. “ If you are unhappy I
am sorry for it, and wish it were otherwise.’' Labor is often used in
the sense of “misem’' or ‘⁴ unhappiness'.’' Comp. Andr. iv. 3. 5 3 Hec.
iii. 1. 6 ; Virg.AEn. i. 241. —31. Quid de te tantum meruisti. “ What is
the offence so grievous to your nature, that asks such cruel vengeance
on yourself ’ἱ ” - Oz’e‘i l “ Alas! alas! ‘’ [In tears.] Many editions
