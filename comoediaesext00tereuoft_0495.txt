Demea, after informing Micio of the crime AEschinus had committed,
asks Non clamas? non insanis ? Micio replies Non. Upon which the
other immediately says Malim quidem : and to make it so, if possible,

nus, Bentley, and others, whom we have followed, give these words to
Micio, who was probably to have completed the sentence by adding
non evenisse, or aliter esse, or some such expression; but is interrupted
by Demea, who, impatient to see his brother so mild, endeavours to
aggravato the crime by adding puer natus est. This has the greater
air of probability. Comp. vs. 19. Reinhardt, who retains our reading
in the text, thinks otherwise in his note, reading non malim quidem,
and supplying insanire, quam sana mente esse. This seems to have been
the invention of Schmieder.

Comp. Heaut. iv. 5. 31.-18. Hoec magis sunt hominis. “This is
more the duty of a prudent man.” Comp. i. 2. 27. Micio could not
have framed a better answer to Demea than this which is now referred
to. We are not always in every thing to proceed with the utmost
severity and rigour. It becomes us, as men, to make allowances, to
enter into one another's soibles, and, as far as is consistent with reason
and prudence, to indulge one another's wants and desires. The poet
has contrived to give Micio, along with his mildness and affability,
a strong bias to justice. This appears in all his behaviour. No
sooner does Hegio represent Pamphila’s case to him, than he is
willing to make her full reparation, and is even anxious to find
AEschinus the same way inclined. And here, when Demea exclaims
against this unequal match, he checks him, by telling him that it is
the more just and humane part, as an injury has been offered, to give
the satisfaction that the law requires, and not suffer the motives of a
sordid avariee to stifle all regard for equity. This is an uncommon
stroke of delicacy, to represent the affable, easy, indulgent Micio, as
