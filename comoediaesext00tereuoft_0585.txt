even naturally offers itself upon the first reading. Antipho had over-
heard Phaedria earnest and importunam, and Dorio obstinate and in·
flexible. He therefore dreads that some brutality may provoke Phaedria
to an act of violence: ne suat quid suo capiti .- “bring vengeance upon
his own head.’' Thus Patrick. The verb suere, like ῥάπτειν, signifies=
“ to plot mischief.” See Homer, ΙΙ. Σ’. 367, and Berndtius‚ Lati—i
con Homericum, in ράπτω. Suo capiti corresponds with the Greek εἷς ἶ
κεφαλήν. ’ Comp. Hec. iii. 1. 54; Cic. Att. viii. 5 ; Tibull. i. 2. 12.
The words idem ego metuo are wanting in some manuscripts, particularly
in Bentley’s, of great antiquity.

8. Hariolare. “ You guess it.” — 9. Foeneratum istuc beneficiam, διο. l
“ You shall have cause to say that this kindness was repaid with interest.”
Comp. Adelph. ii. 2. 11 ; Cic. Amic. c. 9. — Logi. Λόγοι, “ mere
words.'' —- 11. Non est longum .· i. e. triduum hoc. — Cantilenam eandem
canis. Τὸ αὐτὸ ᾄδεις ἆσμα· “ The old song over again.'’ — 12. Tu i
cognatus, δῖα. Comp. Propert. i. 11. 23.— Garri modo. [Phaedria is
about to proceed with his flattery when Dorio interrupts him] “ Ay,
talk away.’' — 13. Adeon’ ingenio esse duro te, διο. “ Is it possible that l
you can be of so cruel and infiexible a nature‚’'· &c. Comp. Andr. i.
5. 10. - 15. Imprudentem. ‘⁴ Ignorant-’¹ — 16. Ut phaleratis dictis,
διο. “ As to fancy you can wheedle me with your fine speecheS, and
carry off the girl for nothing 2²⁹ Phalerata verba are “fine and specious
promises,” which, notwithstanding, mean nothing. Phalerae are ‘⁴ the
splendid trappings of a horse,'' for ornament, and not for use. Comp.
Persius, iii. 20.

17. Miseritum'st. [Antipho behind :] “ I pity him.” —Hei! veris
vincor. [Pliaedria in a low voice, so as not to be heard by Dorio :] “Alas!
he convinces me with the truth.'' — Quam uterque est, διο. [Geta to
Antipho :] “ How well they each support their characters !'’ Madame l
Dacier observes here, that this reflection of Geta is occasioned by what
Phaedria 'had just said: hei l veris vincor. For in this, says she, Phaedria
preserves the character of a man of sense and judgment, who readily
submits to reason3 and Dorio likewise keeps up to his character, in con-
tinuing obstinate and inflexible.

18. Neque Antipho alia, &c. Constr. Quis credat, hoc malum esse
objectum mihi tum, cum Antipho occupatus esset neque alia solicitudine .-
“ Who could suppose that this misfortune would have happened to me
at the very time,when Antipho was taken up with the very same anxiety ;”
i. e. at a time when his own distress prevented him from affording me any
assistance. — 19. Ah l, qaid, διο. [Antipho going up to him :] ‘⁶ Ah!
what now, Phaedria?”— 20. Quod amas. Elegantly for quam amas. Comp.
Eun. ii. 3. 185 Plaut. Epid. v. 1. 46.—21. Nec cum hujusmodi, διο.
Constr. Et cui nunquam usus venit, ut conflictareS, ὅτε. “ And to whom ³
it never happened to encounter such a wretch as this.’' Usus venit for
contigit, or opusfuit. —— 22. Min' domi ’st ἲ &c. ‘⁶ I have, at home Σ yes,
1 have indeed, as the old saying goes, a wolf by the ears ε for I can
neither part with her nor keep her.’' Τῶν ὤτων ἔχω τὸν λύκον, οὔτ’ ’ἶ
ἔχειν, οὔτ’ ἀφεῖναι δύναμαι. This was a common proverb, when one
foresaw difficulties to be encountered, whatever plan he pursued.' We
leam from Suetonius, (Tib. c. 25,) that it was frequently in the mouth of
Tiberius, when he hesitated in what manner to oppose the danger-s he
saw approaching. Α
