into another. Demea, instead of being complaisant, is a mean, servile
flatteren instead of being generous, is extravagantly profuse. The
peet's judgment in this cannot be too much admired.

ACT V. Scene VI.

Demea soon aster accosts Geta in the same strain of complaisance,
and with the same ridiculous affectation. Nothing can be more imper—
tinent than the compliment he makes him, when he is a stranger even
to his very name.

The metre is Trimeter lambio, as before.

It is artful in the poet to represent Demea as a mere rustic, and on a
sudden affecting the fine gentleman, at a loss how to express himself,
and obliged to use the same words over and over again. By this too
he prepares us for the part Demea is to act in the ensuing soenes. —.

dressing them by their names, and endeavouring to gain their favour

by flattery and complaisance. See Livy, iii. 14. ’
