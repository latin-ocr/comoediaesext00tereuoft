iv LIFE OF TERENCE,

very young man. And herein our dramatist may be said to have·'·
amply requited his kind and beneficent master, having been the sole
means of handing down his name to posterity by the lustre of his genius,
when otherwise, probably, it would not have been deemed worthy of
remembrance.

Being of a studious and diligent turn of mind, Terence applied him-
self assiduously to learning, and soon became an elegant and accurate
writer of the Roman language, which his remaining plays sufficiently
evince. He was also gifted, like our immortal Shakespeare, with an
intimate knowledge of human nature : and this, with a good judgment
in the selection of character, eventually raised him very high in public
estimation. His attention was turned entirely, so far as we known to
the drama: and comedy seems the branch he particularly cultivate&
in which he succeeded to such an extent, as to be the second, if not the
first comic poet of the Roman times, many critics preferring him to
Plautus.

It was much to his advantage in the formation of his style, that he
possessed the familiarity and esteem of many noblemen of the highest
rank in Rome, men of great talents and genius, whose favour he conci-
liated by the elegance of his person, the suavity of his manners, the
brilliancy of his wit, and the hilarity of his disposition. In their society,
—among whom Scipio Africanus the younger, Caius Laelius, and
Furius, more particularly honoured him with their friendship‚—he
passed a short but happy life in all the splendid gaiety of the city, and
in all the elegant retirement of the country. But in this diversified
life, so fascinating to youthful minds, literature was not laid aside : he
found time to complete six comedies, which have all come down to us.
Their titles are as follow, in the order in which they are said to have
been exhibited on the stage :—-

. The Andria,

The Hecyra,

. The Heauton Timorumenos,
. The Eunuchus,

The Phormio,

The Adelphi :

of which the second and fifth were taken from Apollodorus, and the re·-
mainder from Menander. Upon his offering the first to the Curule
AEdiles, to be brought on the stage, he was commanded to recite it to
Caecilius‚* a comic poet much esteemed in Rome at that period. When
Terence presented himself to the critic, he found him at supper3 and
was directed to seat himself on a low stool near the table : for being at
the timerbut indifferently clad, the haughty Roman would not conde-
scend, to invite him to his repast. Having taken his seat, he com-
menced reading the Andria3 but had not proceeded through mffiy
lines, when Caecilius, charmed with the style, requested him ·t‹3 take}
place at table near himself—a high honour. He afterwards read ffl&

ι caecilius Statius was author of about thirty comedies: he died mmc- 5855
that is', two years before the representation of the Andria. Vossius, mu. , σε’ in'

place of Caecilius reads Acilia-9, meaning Manius Acilius Ghfflsp? ι of ‚ihc
