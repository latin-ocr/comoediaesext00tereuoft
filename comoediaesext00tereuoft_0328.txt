charge to Davus.‘' Dedere in this sense is unusual. The proper
phrase is dare id negotii. Terence, it is supposed, avoided using dabo 3„
in the same clause with Davo, on account of their very great similarit'y 22-
of sound, especially in a Roman mouth, the Latin V and B being pro- ζ’
nounced nearly alike. — 51. Qui? “ Wherefore ‘2” — Ex sese. “ Of ,ς
his own.” — 52. „Non recte vinctus ’st. Pamphilus by recte meant the f
same as if he had said non juste‚· but the old man answers him jokingly, 1‘
‘⁴ But Ι ordered that he should be properly bound, neck and heels.” ’

At the end of the last scene, Simo retires to give orders for setting ἶ
Davus at liberty. Pamphilus, in the mean time, is expressing his joy ,
at the good fortune that had befallen hirn3 and Charinus coming ’

behind, overhears all.
