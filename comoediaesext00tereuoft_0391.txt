esteemed by the ancients; and that they thought the poet had succeeded
well, in painting the distress of the unfortunate father, appears evi-
dently from these lines of Horace, Sat. i. 2. 20: ›

Vix credere poesia
Quam sibi non sit amicus ; ita ut pater ille, Ter-ente
Fabula quem miserum ,qnato vixisse suyato
Inducit, non se pejw cruciaverit, atque hic.
