Aer 111. scmm 111. 495

adjuta mihi occurs in a fragment of Pacuvius cited by Donatus on the
Adelph. Prol. vs. 16; and nobis adjutasses in Petron. c. 62. We may
therefore dispense with the hypallage, and make «mera depend on quod
ad, understood: “Assist them with respect to the baggage.” — 25.
Cessas .⁹ [Exit Parmena]

 

ACT III. Senm: III.

Pamphilus, having removed all that were about him, is now at
liberty to open his mind freely, and let us into the knowledge of what
he had seen when he went in to visit Philumena, and which was the
cause of that sorrow and dejection, which now appear so manifest in
¹ his looks. Considering the perplexity into which Pamphilus is now
thrown, we are not to wonder at the concern he seems to be in.
Though he has resolved to abandon his wife, yet it costs him a hard
struggle; for when love -has once firmly taken root, it is not easy,
..even upon the greatest provocation, to conquer it.

,The first sorty-eight verses of this scene are Tetrameter Trochaics
Catalectic : the remaining six are Trimeter Iambics. .

1. Nequeo, δίο. This seems to be imitated from Homer, Od. ix. 14.
Τί πρῶτον, τί δ’ ἔπειτα, τί δ’ ὑστάτιον καταλέξω. - 4. Qua me propter.
Tmesis, for qua propter me. — Me eduxi foras. For foras prodii. Comp.
iv. 1. 7; Cic. ad Div. x. 32. -- 5. Intro me corripui. For raptim introii.
Comp. iv. 1. 3. See Heinsius on Virg. AEn. vi. 472. So se intro con-
jecit, Heaut. ii. 3. 36. — 8. Id quod. For propterea qaod. —— 9. Voltum
immutari. Comp. Hor. Sat. ii. 8. 84; Cic. de Orat. iii. 57. - 10.
Obtulerat. Any thing that happens unexpectedly‚ whether good or
bad, is said offerri.

12. Ejus videndi. “Of seeing Philumena.’' Videndi here is the
gerund in di, and not a participle as Zumpt has asserted; for had it
been a participle it should have been videndae. We read legendi libro-
rum in Cicero. So copia spectandi novarum, in the Prologue to the
Heaut. vs. 29. See Perizon. on Sanct. Min. iii. 8. —- Recta. Supply vz‘a
from the Andria, iii. 4⁴. 21. —1‘6. corripui me. For me proripui. Comp.
vs. 5 ; Livy, ii. 24. — 18. Mater. Myrrhina, the mother of Philumena.
— Ut limen exirem. “As I was passing the threshold.” Exire limen
is the same as eoeire limine, or de limine. So egredi portam, urbem, διο.
—Ad genua accidit. Ad genua for genibus. Comp. Petron. c. 8ος
Senec. Troad. 6903 Sueton. Caes. c. 203 Eurip. Hec. 339. See Ruhn-
ken on Rutil. Lup. ii. 96. They also said in genua procumbere. —— 19.
Miseritum est. “ I pitied her.'’ Comp. Heaut. iii. 1. 54.—- Profecto

’ hoc sic est, διο. “And certainly, ’tis in the very nature of our mmds,

to rise and fall according to our fortunes.'’ Apollodorus ε Οὕτως ἕκα-
στος διὰ τὰ πράγματα σεμνὸς ἣν καὶ ταπεινός. Homer, Od. Σ. 136.
Τοῖος γὰρ νόος ἐστὶν ἐπιχθονίων ἀνθρώπων, Οῗον ἐπ’ ἦμαρ ἄγῃσι πατὴρ
ἀνδρῶν τε θεῶν τε. — 20. Ut res dant sese. For ut res eveniunt. So in

elevated.” ——- Humiles. ‘⁴ Humble, abJect.''
