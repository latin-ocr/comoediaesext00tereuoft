person was said to be imprudens, who was not apprehensive of any

ACT I. Scene IV.

’ The midwife is called to Glycerium, that by this means an oppor-
tunity may be offered to Pamphilus of meeting Mysis. Terence,
as Donatus observes, frequently makes use of this compendious man-
ner of carrying on the plot, that the characters in coming out, speak

‚ what they are about to do, and, at the same time, the discourse is so

contrived, as to let us know what is doing by others.

As to the metre of this scene, the first six verses are Tetrameter
Trochaics 3 the last two Tetrameter Iambics.

1. Audivi, Archylis, διο. , [Enter Mysis speaking to a servant within]
“ I have heard you already, Archylis.’' ,Iamdudum is often said of a
time just passed. — 2. Sane pol illa temulenta 'st. “ That Lesbia is a

thorough drunken jade.'’ Pol is a contraction of per Pollucem, “by '

Pollux.” So edepol, “by the temple of Pollux.'’ This kind of oath
was used by both men and women. But me Castor was used only by

women: me Hercule only by men. Temulentus‚ from temetum, an ,

ancient word for vinum, supposed to be derived from the words tenet ἶ
mentem, because it overpowers the mental faculties. Sane must be con- ’

strued with temulenta. —3. Primo. As being most dangerous. -4.
Importunitatem spectate aniculae. [Coming forward.] “ Observe how
earnest the old gossip is !” meaning Archylis. Spectare is used in‘the
same sense, Eun. v. 5. 243 Heaut. v. 2. 38. Importunas properly sig-
nifies “badly provided with harbours.'' Hence figuratively, “ incon-
venient‚'’ “ troublesome‚” ‘⁴ importunate.'' Whence importunitas, “an
impudent obstinacy,’' which regards neither time, place, nor circum-
stance. -— 5. Quia compotrioe ejus est. “Because this Lesbia is her pot-
companion.” —6. Huic . . . illi. Huic refers to Glycerium illi to com-
potrz‘oe, Lesbia. The usual order of hic and ille is sometimes neglected,
when no ambiguity can arise. Thus in Ovid, Met. 1. 539. Sic Deus et
virgo est.- hic spe celer, illa timore—8. Turba for perturbatio.- “If
this commotion means us any ill.’' Itis often put also for “ a quarrel,”
as in Eun. iv. 4. 58.

 

ACT 1. SCENE V.

Simo, aster parting with Davus, goes to the forum, where, meeting
with Pamphilus, he pretends, according to the scheme laid open to
Sosia, that he must that day prepare for his marriage with Chremes'
daughter. Pamphilus, disconcerted by a proposal so sudden and unex—
pected‚ deliberates here with himself what he is to do. Mysis is intro-
duced to turn the scale. At her appearance, all his former soft and
tendor sentiments in respect of Glycerium revive, and he is confirmed
in the resolution of adhering to her in spite of all opposition.

The two most beautiful characters in this play, are the father and
son. It has already been observed how much Sir Richard Steele falls
short of Terence in delineating the first3 and though Bevi] is plainly
