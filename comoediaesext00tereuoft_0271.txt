quire some time. We are also to observe, that this verb, besides its
common signification relating to things future, is also often used to
express what is premised in discourse. Comp. Corn. Nepos, Themist.
ο. 7. -- 20. Quas. For quales. “ These are not real nuptials, such as
you suppose them to be.’' Comp. Eun. ii. 2. 42—43'. Has by syllepsis.
Regularly, it should be hae. -—- 21. Rem omnem. This is the first
narration in our author, and an exceedingly beautiful one. The nar-
rations in the Greek tragedies have been long and justly admired, and
from this and many other parts of Terence, we may fairly conclude that
their comedies were equally excellent in that particular. Terence,
says Diderot, stands alone in every thing, but especially in his narra-
tions. It is a pure and transparent stream, which flows always evenly,
with no more swiftness or noise than that which it derives from its
course and the ground it runs over. No wit, no display of sentiment,
not a sentence that wears an epigrammatic air, none of those defini-
tions always out of place, except in Nicole or Rochefoucauld. When
he generalizes a maxim, it is in so simple and popular a manner, you
would believe it to be a common proverb which he has quoted: nothing
but what belongs to the subJect. I have read this poet, he adds, over
and over again with attention3 there is in him no superfluous scenes,
nor any thing superfluous in the scenes. —- 22. Eo pacto. “And thus
you shall learn.” Paeto for modo. —- Consilium. “ My i11tention.'’
Comp. Hec. iii. 5. 44 ; Sall. Cat. e. 4.

24. Excessit ex ephebis. ‘⁶ Left his youthsul companions.‘' So ,
ἔξελθε-ἲν ἐξ ἐφήΒων, in Xenophon. A young man of eighteen years old ’.
was called ἔφηβος at Athens. It was at that age that the Greeks ap-
plied themselves to the study of philosophy, and chose some particular τ
sect, to which they adhered. Plato's Dialogues give us a sufficient ²
insight into that custom. — 25. Liberius, διο. “ He had freer scope of
living.” ——- 28. Plerique omnes. ‘⁶ All young men for the most part&
This is borrowed from the Greek πλείονες πάντες. Comp. Phorm. i. 3. ’
2ος Caes. B. G. ii. 30. —29. Animum ad aliquod studium adjungant.
“ Direct their attention to some one pursuit.'’ Studium signifies that
kind of pursuit which engages and delights the mind. Comp. Hec. iv.
2. 18. 19. —30. Alere. This infinitive depends on the substantive ε
studium, conformably to the Greek syntax, in place of the gerund,
alendi. —- Canes ad venandum. For canes venaticos, “ hunting dogs.⁸'
The preposition ad sometimes signifies ‘⁴ for the purpose.'’ Comp.
Propert. iv. 9. 11 3 Virg. AEn. x. 253 ; Livy, xxii. 19, xxxiv. 6. The
words ad philosophos depend on animum adjungant. —- 31. Horum ille,

another.” Egregie for vehementer, or valde, ‘⁶ excessively.’' Comp. i.
5. 38. —- Praeter cetera. For prce ceteris, or plus quam cetera. Comp.
vs. 94. —32. Studebat. “ Eagerly pursued.” This verb is construed
with an accusative also, Hec. ii. 2. 20; Cic. Phil. vi. 7.-—33. Non
injuria. “ And not without reason.” Comp. Eun. iii. 1. 43. — Nam
id arbitror, διο, “ For I consider this old maxim exceedingly useful .
in life: Too much os one thing is good for nothing.’' Apprime means
the same as ἐν πρώτοις, imprimis, ‘⁴ particularly.” -34. Ut ne quid nimis.
Supply agas. The Greeks say μηδὲν ἄγαν. This is a sentiment not
unbecoming a servant, because it is common, and is therefore not put
into the mouth of the master. Though the commentators are full of
admiration of this golden saying‚ “ Do nothing to excess,'’ yet it'gis
plain, that Terence introduces it here as a characteristic sentiment.
