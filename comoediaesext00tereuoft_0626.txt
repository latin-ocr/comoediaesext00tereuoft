tremely artful and comic. What then is intrigue? If it be the ἀξιῶ
matie narration of a story, so laid out as to produce pleasant situations,
I will not scruple to pronounce, that there is more intrigue in the
Adelphi than in L'Eeole des Maris. The reader has already seen
several strictures on the fifth act, but the particular objection made by
Voltaire to the catastrophe is founded on a mistake: the complaisance,
gaiety, and liberality of Demea being merely assumed, and his awk-
wardness in affecting those qualities full as comio as the admired
catastrophe of L’Ecole des Maris,· which being produced in a forced
manner by the disguise of Isabelle, and the broad cheat put upon
Sganarelle before his face, is certainly deficient in the probability
necessary to the incidents of legitimate Comedy. -It is not without
reluctance that I have been drawn into an examination of the compa-
rative merits of these two excellent pieces: nor do Ι think there is in
general a more invidious method of extolling one writer, than by
depreciating the productions of another.

“ Baron, the author of the Andrz‘enne, has also written a comedy,
called.L'Eeole des Pares, (⁶ The School for F ath'ers,') built on this play
of Terence. The pieee opens with a very elegant, though pretty close
version, of the first act of the Adelphz' ,· but on the whole, Ι think this
attempt less happy than his first. The bringing of Clarice and Pam-
phile on the stage has no better effect, than his introduction of Glicerie
in the Andriemze. Telamon and Alcee are drawn with neither the
strength nor delicacy of Micio and Demea3 and the old man’s change
of character in the fifth act is neither rejected nor retained, but rather
mangled and deformed. On the whole, it were to be wished that
Baron had adhered still more closely to Terence, or, like Moliere,
deviated still further from him: for, as the play now stands, his atten- -
tion to the Roman poet seems to have thrown a constraint on hia
genius, and taken off the air of an original; while his alterations have
rendered L’Ecole des Pares but a lame imitation and imperfect image
of the Adelphz' of Terence.

“In our own language, the Squire of Alsatz‘a, of Shadwell, is also
founded on this play. But the muse of White Friars has but little
right to the praises due to that of Athens and Rome. Shadwell’s play,
though drawn from so pure a source, is rather a farce of five acts than
a comedy; nor has it the least comparative merit, either in the plan
or execution, except in the intention to give the character of Ctesipho
more at large than it is drawn in the original.'’—COLMAN.

HECYRA. Second Prologue‚ vs. 49. — Pretio emtas meo. “ Bought at
my expense.'’

‘⁴ These words I have rendered literally‚ though there is a great disputo
among commentators concerning them. Donatus, and after him
Madame Dacier, explain pretio by aestimatione pretii, importing that
Ambivius valued the play when the AEdiles were to purchase it.
Madame Dacier therefore supposes the case to be thus: When the
aediles had a mind to purchase a copy for the stage, they gave it vto the
master of the company to peruse, and set a price upon it. If it
failed, the master was bound to return the money to the magistrates;
