and tghat only the sense of his duty to his parentgcould have coiiquere'd
his resolution. Nor even after marriage does he find it an easy matter
to withdraw his affections from the person on whom he had once placed
them. Time, consideration, the peevish behaviour of Bacchis, the
temper, prudence, and good sense of his wife, all conspire to bring
him to reason and sound reflection. —49. Despondit ei. Comp. Andr.

73. Decrerim. We have in this speech a manifest proof of the
natural good disposition of Pamphilus. He could not reconcile himself
to the marriage3 and as he “had determined’' to part from his wife,
he thought it would be doing her an injury, not to return her as he
received her. But still he is anxious how to accomplish this. To
own the real reason, would be highly improper; and to restore one
to whom there could not be, so much as pretended, any tolerable
reason of dislike, would be insolent and assuming. He resolves,
therefore, upon a middle way, by continuing his resa-ve, to make her
sensible that there is no likelihood of their ever living with any satis-
faction together. By this means he persuades himself she will at
length resolve of herself to withdraw, and save him the confusion that
will be unavoidable by taking it upon himself. Comp. Heaut. i. 1. 95,
