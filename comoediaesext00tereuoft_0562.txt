here, that Terence follows the same method which he pursued invhis
other comedies ; of introducing a protatic personage, that is, a character
foreign to the fable ; that while the story is opened to him, the audience
may be informed of as much as is necessary for them to know. But
although this scene is introduced merely for the instruction of the spec-
tator, yet the poet has contrived to season it with a great deal of wit
and humour ; and, indeed, that is the highest pitch of dramatic art, to
seem to intend nothing but the amusement of the spectator, and to fol-
low the natural course of the plot, while you are actually endeavour-

tiful, and so admirable a model of narration, that it gives one pain to
make the slightest objection to it.

Popularis. Properly “a fellow-townsman;” and though not born
in it, a person who has been registered with the inhabitants. The very
names, Davus and Geta, plainly prove that they could not be country-
men, in the strict sense of that word. — 2. Erat ei de ratiuncula, &c.
“ There was a trifle of money of his in my hands, the balance osan old
accountss' Terence here speaks of a small sum, and, therefore, pur-
posely uses diminufflves, ratiuncula and pauxillulum. This conveys the
idea more strongly, and makes way for the reflection which follows, of
the great hardship that servants should be deprived of the little they
have saved with so much pains. —— 3. Reliqz'ium. Sopecuniam reliquam.
Cic. Att. xvi. 16. — 4. Id ut conficerem. Supply monuit me, or oravit.-
“ He desired I would make up this sum, and pay him.'’ Comp. v. 5.
11 ; Cic. pro Cluent. c. 25. — 6. Ei. For Antipho‘s wife, as a bride-
gift. — corraditur. “ Is scraped together.’' Comp. Heaut. i. 1. 89.
On the day after marriage, presents were sent to the bride by her friends
and relations, and even by the slaves of her husband. Presents were
also sent on birth-days, and on several other occasions. -— 7. Com-
paratam. “Ordained,’' “instituted'’ Comp. Eumi. l. 2; Cic. Rosc.
Amer. c. 36.

9. Quod ille unciatim, διο. “ What he scarce, ounce by ounce, from
short allowance, sorely defrauding his own appetite, has spared, poor
wretch! shall she sweep all at once, unheedIng with what labour it was
got.” These verses are extremely fine and elaborate, and make an
exact climax, almost every word, as Donatus has observed, having a
considerable emphasis and energy3 thetouches are strong, forcible, and
natural. The images of poverty and distress are greatly heightened
by the contrast which immediatelyfollows. — De demenso suo. Demen—

ξ sum was a measure of corn containing, as is commonly supposed, four

ἱ bushels, which was delivered out to the slaves monthly, as their allow-
ance. - 10. Defrudans genium. Defrudans archaically for defraudans.

the opposite to which‘ 1s indulgere genio. See Servius on Virg. Georg.
i. 302. - 11. Illa. The bride. — Universum. This is contrasted with
unciatim.

13. Ferietur alio munere. ‘⁴ Shall bleed again 3¹⁹ i. e. shall be obliged
to make a new present. Ruhnken explains ferietur by mulctabitur,
“shall be afflicted;” and thinks it ametaphor from gladiatore. See
Broukhusius on Propert. iv. 5. 44. —- Ubi hera pepererit. Five days
after the birth of a child, gists were usually sent to the mother, md 150
the midwife. See the Scholiast on AristophaneS, Lys. 758. -- 14. U&
