* ticle quia, or quod, is generally placed after this particle. Comp. Cic.
Att. xiii. 35. ——Istuc aequi bonique facio. “ Ι am not concerned about
it.’' Istuc, the plot against Menedemus for obtaining the money. So
in Livy, xxxiv. 32, nos aequz‘ bonique facimus, ‘⁶ we rest content.” Cicero,
Att. vii. ¹7, omits the conjunction: animus meus istuc aequz‘ boni facit,
‘⁶ my mind takes all that in good part.” Comp. Phorm. iv. 3. 32; and
see Perizon. on Sanct. Min. ii. 3. —40. Cum maxime. “Ort μάλιπα.
“ By all means.'’

{¹ illud dicunt. “ This, which is in every one’s mouth, is a true proverb.''
' Comp. Adelph. i. 1. 3; v. 8. 32. Verum was the reading prior to
Bentley’s edition. It is used for vere in Livy, xxxv. 19.-48. Jm
summum, &c. ‘⁴ The strictest law is ost the highest wrong.'’ This saying
had passed into a proverb ; to which we have something analogous in

Δ our language, in the common saying, “The more law, the less

ri‘ght.'’ Comp. Cic. Off. i. 10. Menander probably made use of itin
this very play, as the same sentiment is to be found among his

fragments:
καλὸν
Οἱ νόμοι σφόδρ’ εἰσὶν, ὁ δ’ ὁρῶν τοὺς νόμους*
Λίαν ἀκριβῶς, συκοφάντης φαίνεται.

“ The law, 'tis true, is good and excellent3
But he who takes the letter of the law
Τοο strictly, is a pettyfogging knave.''—C'0lman.

This fragment is found in Stobaeus, Serm. 185.

49. Haud faciam. “ Ι will not make these evasions,” but give her
the money. —Immo aliis si licet, tibi non licet. ‘¹ Nay, though others

Lucan, viii. 250, Auetus opes, for opibus. In Nepos, Thrasyb. c. 2.
we read auctae opes.- and in Cic. Catil. iv. 9, auctae exaggeratoeque
sortzmae. Esse in re is rather unusual. The line cited from Horace,
Epist. i. 16. 68. is not by any means similar. The old reading was,
Omnes te in lauta, et bene acta parte putant. Palmarius proposed,
Omnes te in lauta et bene uncta parte putant ; which is approved of hy
Burmann on Petron. c. 43. For our reading we are indebted to‘
Bentley. —51. Quin egomet, διο. “ Well, I will myself take the money
to Bacchis.'’ —52. Quia enim, &a “Because the suspicion of being

ἶ her gallant is now transferred to him.’' —- 54. Id. The circumstance
¹of his being her gallant.-——-55. Conficiam facilius, διο. “I shall
-accomplish more easily what I design.'' Conficiam has a double
meaning; for we also find conficere argentum, as in Eun. v. 4. 6; Phorm.
v. 5. 3. Chremes little suspected the real intent of these words,
otherwise he would not have been so forward in bringing· the money.
He understood it of their plot against Menedemus. We are to sup·-
