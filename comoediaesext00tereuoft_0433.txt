7. Prmnittit. ‘⁴ Threatens.’' Comp. Virg. AEn. ii. 96. In like manner
”nixari is sometimes put for promittere. Clinia here speaks apart to
Syrus. -—— 8. Dormiunt. “ They sleep ;” i. e. they are in fancied security.
Comp. Pharm. v. 8. 18. Hedelin interprets this literally: but surely
nothing can be more plain, from the whole tenor of the scene, than

διο. “ In saith, I’ll rouse them.” Comp. Andr. v. 2. 23.—9. Audistin’
modo, διο. This is a story invented merely to frighten Syrus. [She
speaks aloud.] Constr. Audistine villam Charini, quam iste homo modo*

Hence currere and percurrere curriculo denote the greatest speed in run-

12. Quid haec coeptat? [Syrus‚ behind :] “What is she about?’'
Coeptare signifies “ to attempt‚’' or “ to be about doing any thing.” —

Asservari. “Detained against my will.¹’ Comp. Andr. V. 2. 24.- ’

[Syrus says this to himseffi] —- Bacchis, mane, mane. [Comes sorward.]
These single words, spoken in haste, and with great earnestness, serve
well to mark the great fright that Syrus is in; and accordingly we find
*he mentions the money, and promises it instantly, as one ready to
undertake any thing to hinder her from putting her present threats in
execution. —— 15. Ι. [Το Phrygia] “ Go.'' ’1- Quz‘n est, &Q ‘⁶ Nay,
but the money is ready for you.” — Quin ego, Sco. “ Nay, then, I
stay.” [Bacchis jeeringly mimics the words qs Syrus—Phrygia
returns.] — 16. Ut lubet. [Carelessly.·] “ When you please ι do Ι press

19. Dignam me putas, &c. “Do you think me a fit person to play
your jests upon ?’' — Non est temere. ‘⁶ It is not without reason,” i. e.
I am not acting unadvisedly. — 20. Etiam tecum hic res mihi est?
[Addressing herself to Clinia.] “ And am Ι still to pass here for your

family of Menedemus. —Mz'nime. [Syrus, who alone had any know-
ledge of this plot, answers sor Clinia :] “ Certainly not. I give you

On this verse, Patrick observes: There is some difficulty in this pas-
sage ς nor, indeed, have almost any of the commentators made tolerable
