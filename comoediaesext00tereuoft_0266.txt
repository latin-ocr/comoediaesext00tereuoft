his thoughts fi'xed' on matrimony.'' Donatus says this is a metaphor

taken fromsspersons sailing into port. Appellere properly signifies “ to ’
bring a ship to land.'’ Hence “ to apply” tosany thing. The oppo- ’
site is solvere. — 2. Id sibi negoti, διο. “ Imagined' it to be his only ’
task.'' Negoti for negotii. This word often signifies ‘⁴ care,’' “ trouble,'’ j

and “ labour.” -— 3. Populo ut placerent, διο. For ut populo placerent

fabulae. Comp. Ovid‚ Met. xiv. 350. The relative lias- the noun, to ὲ

which it should refer, in the samev case with itself, and placed after it.
This is common enough in Greek. Thus in AEsch. Sept. c. Th. 549,
Ἐστιν δὲ καὶ τῷδ’, ὃν λέγεις τὸν Ἀρκάδα.. See Matth. Gr. Gr. ξ 474, a.
Compare vs. 26, and Ean. iv. 3. 11. Placere means, ‘⁴ to· gain the
applause of the people,” and, as Ruhnken observes, is a· very appro-
priate word here. See the Inscription of the Hecyra. -Fecissea
“ Composed‚” not scripsisset. Virgil uses facere in the same manner,
Ecl. iii. 86. Thus poeta is derived from ποιεῖν, “ to make.” —4. Iri-2
telligit. “ He finds,” ‘⁴ he discovers.'’ He finds it far otherwise than

he at first believed. What we believe, says Donatus, ot'ten proves ·

y false; what we find is certain. Intelligere is used in the same sense by
ς Caes. B. Ο. ii. 24; B. G. ii. 33. - 5. Operam abutitur. “ He consumes

ᾖ his time and labour.'’ Abati not only signifies to “ abuse‚” “ mis·
ξ apply‚’' or “ apply to a purpose different from the intended one,” but ’
2 also “to avail one’s self‚” “to take advantage of‚'’ “ to. use‚” “to

consume.'' It is construed with an accusative likewise‘ in Lucr. v.
1932, and in Plaut. Poen. v. 4. 29. — 6. Qui argumentum narret. The
proper intention of a prologue is to explain the plot of the drama.
Qui here is not a nominative to narret and respondeat, but an ablative,
signifying “ wherei11,'' or “ whereby.”——“ He consumes his time,
not in the act wherein he> tells,’' i. e. not by· telling the argument.
Donatus and Ruhnken are both in error, taking qui in this passage as
put for ut. The construction of Missi sunt qui consulerent Apollinem,
in Nepos, i. l, is quite different. In this indeed the qui, which is the
nominative to consulerent, may be said to be put sonat, or qui consu-
lerent may be taken together for the supine consultum, “to consult
Apollo.’' The sentence from Livy, xxvi. 6, cited by Ruhnken, is
similar to this of Nepos—7. Veteris poetae. The adJective veteris
is used in contempt, for veternosi, “ worn out‚'’ or “ superannuated.”
Comp. Ean. iv. 4. 21. The old doting and malicious 'poet- alluded to
was Lucius Lavinius, according to Donatus3 but Madam Dacier will
have his name to be Luscius Lanuvinus. —- 8. Vitio dent. Th same
as vitio vertant, vitio tribuant, crimini dent, “ they lay to his charge.”
Comp. Adelph. iii. 3. &lu—Animum advortite is put for the more usual
animadvortite, (Comp. Ean. iii. 1. 7 ,) and is construed· with au aecu-
sative in the sense of “ observe.” Advertere without the substantive
animam is used in the same signification. Animadvertere, ‘⁴ to punish‚”
takes an accusative with the preposition in, as in Sall. Cat. e. 51.

9. Menander fecit. Here again fecit, not scripsit. Comp. vs. 3.
From this account it is plain, that Terence did not in this play weave
two different stories of Menander together in that vicinus manner which
is generally imputed to him ς but that the argument of these *two plays

being nearly the same, Terencehaving pitched upon the Andriam for

the ground-work of his fable, enriched it with such parts of. thePer-ir'z-
thian as naturally fell in with that plan. We are told by Donatus,
thartha first soene of. our author's Andrian is almost a lioeral translat-
