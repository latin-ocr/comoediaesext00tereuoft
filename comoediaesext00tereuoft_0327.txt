Aer v. senus 1v. 289

eliptically for dignus ad odium. Bentley and Ruhnken suppose an
aposiopesis after religione, and take odium as said for homo odiose. -x
38. Nodum in scirpo quaeris. This is a proverbial expression, signi·
fying that a plain case is made to appear difficult. Scir-pus, ⁴⁴ a bul-
rush,” on which there are no knots. — Quid istuc est ? ‘⁴ What doubt l,
is that? ’' ’

40. Numquid meministi ‚⁹ Numquid for the simple num, as in Livy,
vii. 25. —Id quaero. “ I am endeavouring to recollect it.'’—Egon’
hujus, διο. [Pamphilus to himseffi] “ Shal] then his memory oppose
my bliss, when I can minister the cure myself?” —43. Omnes nos
gaudere hoc, &c. “ Ι trust, Chremes, you believe that we all rej0ice at
this discovery.'' A similar repetition to credo credere occurs again
v. 5. 2. —- 44. Quid restat ? ‘⁴ What now prevents that I should marry
her ’.ν’ or, according to Schmieder, “ What now prevents our reconci-
liation? '’ -— 45. Jamdudum. This refers here, not to time, but to the
measure and degree of the thing. It is equivalent to satis superque,
“ abundantly‚’' as in the Eun. iii. 1. 58. — 46. De uxore. [To
Chremes,] “With respect to my wife Glycerium, as I have already
obtained her, Chremes, I hope, will have no objection.⁷' Causa op-
tuma '’st. “Your reason is unobjectionable.'' — 47. Nempe. Pam-
philus, turning to his father, says in a suppliant voice, “ surely,” —
intending to have said, “Surely, Sir, you will not object now? you
will not hold (quid aliud) a different sentiment from that of Chremes ἱ) ”
To this Simo replies, Id scilicet. Supply aio. “ I certainly assent.''
Id, the same as¹ Chremes. Hereupon Chremes, finding all parties had
consented, names the portion. Donatus, and some others afterhim, ·
understand these words of Simo and Pamphilus as requiring a fortune
of Chremes with his daughter: and one of them, Guyetus, says that
Simo, in order to explain his meaning, should, in the representation,
produce a bag of money. This surely, says Colman, is precious
refinement, worthy the genius of a true commentator.

48. Decem talenta, Equal to 31937. 10³. The Athenians computed :¹⁶
their money by Drachmae, Minae, and Talents. A Drachma was ἶ
equal to 7ffd. of'our money: 100 Drachmae made 1 Mina: 4:²3. 4s. 7 d. ;
and 60 Minae, 1 ΤεῑΙΕΠῖπέΒῙ93. 153. -Λοοὶρὶο, To confirm the por· ³
tion, it was necessary that the party to whom it was offered should say
accipio conditionem——Mecum Supply veni—49. Nam illam, δερ.
[Eoeeunt Chremes and Crita] “ Crito is, as Donatus calls him, persona
in catastrophen machinata ‚· a character formed to bring about the cata-
strophe. To supply his place in the sable, Sir Richard Steele has con-
verted Phania, the brother of Chremes mentioned in the foregoing
scene, into a sister, and substituted Isabella for Crito. But here, I
think, and in almost every circumstance of the discovery, the art of the
English poet is much inferior to that of his original. Isabella does not
maintain her importance in the drama so well as Crito. Indiana indeed
serves to add a degree of pathos to the scene3 but the relation of the
incidents of her life, and throwing off her little ornaments in a kind of “
tragedy-rant, till Isabella appears to unravel the mystery, is surely
much less natural than the minute detail of circumstances so finely
produced by our author. It is, says Donatus, the greatest praise, when
the spectator may imagine those things to happen by chance, which
are produced by the utmost industry of the poet.'' —Colmam
