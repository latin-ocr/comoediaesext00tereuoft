the prologue speaker was to play, (which Ι apprehend to have been
Menedemus) and not the whole comedy: and the lines immediately
Subsequent, Ι think, confirm this interpretation, as they contain a
description of the laborious characters he usually represented, Clamore
summo, cum labore maxumo,which he urges as a plea for his being allowed
to act an easier part at present. As to the difficulty started by Madame
Dacier concerning the line,

Si lenis est, ad alium defertur yreyem,

nor do I see the least necessity of applying that verse to any one of the
other actors of the company, in order to warrant this interpretation.”

“ In the present piece the style is pure.’' — “ Terence, with great pro-

very deficient in point of action, and therefore determined to repair that
defect by the vivacity and purity of the language 3 and he has perfectly
succeeded.” Daeier. — “With all due deference to Madame Dacier,
the play is, in my mind, far from being destitute of action; the plot
being as artfully constructed, and containing as many unexpected turns·
