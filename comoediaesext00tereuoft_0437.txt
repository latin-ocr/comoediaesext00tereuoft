pose that Syrus, when he said this, turned towards the spectators, and,
by some significant looks and gestures, made them sensible of his
purpose, that under a show of plotting against Menedemus, he was
making his own master the dupe of his cunning. -— 56. Ipse adeo adest.

ACT IV. Senam VI.

Clitipho had been ordered to take a walk somewhere, and leave the
lovers at liberty. He was obliged to comply, but with great reluctance;
and highly offended at Syrus, who had made the malicious proposal.
We have him here returning3 and still under discontent, which breaks
out upon Syrus, as soon as he comes up to him; but when he hears
that the projeci: has succeeded, and that he is just then to receive the
money, he changes his note, and wants again to be in favour with Syrus.

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.

12. Noe me istuc, διο, “ Reany, Ι am glad you told me this before
you had the 1noney.'' - 14. Quid igitur, &c. These words come with
a milder air and countenance, that shows him under some concern for
his former rashness. When he hears that the money is ready, he
*changes his behaviour, and endeavours to excuse what his resent-
ment had prompted him to say: “What would you have me say to
you, who have created me so much trouble, and tantalized me by a
sight of my mistress, when I am now excluded from her presence ‘2¹’—
Abiisti. “ You went and brought.''—16. Jam uon sum iratus. This is
extremely natural and happy. Syrus was aware that he had mortified
Clitipho extremely by what he had done, and that one of his impatient
temper could not easily brook it. His own project, too, had succeeded
to his wish, and this had put him in extreme good humour. He had
a satisfaction in thinking he could make Clitipho happy, and was, at
the same time, impatient to acquaint him with his address and good
fortune. All these together make him forget Clitipho’s ill-timed
anger, and accept of his defence. -17. Apud nos. “At our house.‘’
