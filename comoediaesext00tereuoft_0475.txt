broke into Sannio’s house. This scene is one of the most diverting in
the whole play, and represents how men of a severe, rigid character,
tenacious of virtue and honesty, are generally ridiculed or hated
wherever they come. In the second act, AEschinus and Syrus, followed
by Sannio, went to the forum to look for Micio. They had told him,
by this time, the whole affair as it happened; and the old man, far from
being angry, was rather delighted with the humour of the thing, and
paid the money immediately. As he imagined the young men, pleased
that their project had succeeded, would like to spend the day in mirth‚
he moreover gives half a mina to Syrus to be laid out in provisions.
These he had brought home, and is preparing to have them dressed,
when he is accosted by Demea. The conversation is full of humour
and variety, and, perhaps, one of the best conducted in all Terence.
Here we see the fondness of a father towards his favourite son3 the
pleasure he takes to encourage a disclosure that flatters his partiality;
and the artful management of a cunning slave, who, taking advantage
of the old gentleman’s bias, exposes him all the while to ridicule.

The metre is Trimeter Iambic.

himself where to seek for him, that he may take him home and remove
