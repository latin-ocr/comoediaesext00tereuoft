70. Adducimus. Comp. Adelph. iv. 4. 21. Here we enter upon the
other part of the fable, which the poet has most artfully complicated
with the main subject, by making Syrus bring Clitipho’s mistress
along with Antiphila. This part of the story, we know was not in
Menander. — 72. O hominis impudentem audaciam. Comp. Phaedr. iii.
5. 9. - 73. Non fit sine periclo. This verse is cited by the Scholiast on
Juvenal, xiv. 224. Comp. Herod. vii. 50. After clearing up what
regarded Antiphila, Bacchis comes upon the stage. Clitipho, asto-
nished at her being one of the company, asks Syrus hastily where he
meant to bring her3 and still more surprised at his answering “ to his
father's house‚'' seems shocked at his confidence and boldness. He,
in defence of himself, tells him, that no great and memorable attempt
can be made without incurring some danger: a plea specious and good
in appearance, and suited to the character of that kind of slaves, who
have always a great share of vanity‚ and affect to give an air of im—
portance to their most trifling actions. -—- Facinus magnum. Μέγα καὶ

at my expense.” Comp. Adelph. ii. 2. 20. —Is quaesitum. Comp. Andr.

will you do with her ?” asse. where is she to be kept? Comp. Eun. v.
1. 21. - At enim. “ But truly—’' Syrus intended to have said¹ what
he afterwards says vss. 81. 82. -77, Ita res est Jzaec nnnc, quasi cum.
Syrus seems to want here to illustrate his design by a simile, which, as
it does not readily occur, we are to suppose him to lengthen out in
pronunciation the two last words quasi cum, which draws upon him
the smart reply from his master. —79. Enimvero. Comp. Andr. i.
3. 1. —- Multimodis. For vehementer. Comp. Andr. v. 4. 36. Nothing
can serve better than this, to make us sensible what a great master
of human life the poet was, and how well he knew to paint the passions.
Syrus knew of what consequence he was to his master3 and that as
he was intrusted with the management of his amours, he would not
be willing to fall out with him at the present juncture. This makes
him take so much upon him as he does in the present answer3 for
servile natures, when they think they have any one in their power, are
peculiarly apt to affect a haughty, important air, and show of what con-
sequence they are. —— 80. Audiundum hercle est, tace. As these words
are generally supposed to be addressed by Clinia to Clitipho, it occa-
sions some difficulty to reconcile them to what the same Clinia says
a little before to Syrus, vs· 78; for there he seems to commend
Clitipho for interrupting Syrus 3 and here he is angry with him
because he had interrupted him. But the reason of this will easily

*of great consequence, so Clinia is for winking at it, and indlilging
him for the present, rather than, by an unseasonable opposition, to
entangle affairs that appeared already but too intricate and confused.
We are, therefore, to suppose this addressed to Clitipho, with particular
nods and gestures which he could not but understand.
