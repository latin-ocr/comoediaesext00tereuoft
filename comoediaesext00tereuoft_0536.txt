ACT III. Scnnn V.

Pamphilus has no sooner rid himself of Parmeno, than he is thrown
into a new perplexity, that distresses him greatly: for while he is re-
volving with himself how he should be best able to keep his promise to
Myrrhina, of concealing her daughter's misfortune, the two suthem,
Phidippus and Laches, come up to him. After the first salutatione, and
some conversation on indifferent subjects‚ Laches introduces the men·-
tion of his wife, pretending that she had been sent for by her father,
but would now return. Pamphilus lets them understand that he is
acquainted with the whole matter, and had determined not to take her
back. In spite of all their importunity, he adheres to his resolution;
but as his father presses him hard, and he is at a loss to. answer, he
thinks it prudent to retire, lest he may, perhaps, betray himself.
Phidippus, excited by this, as he thinks it, unreasonable obstinacy,
goes off in much displeasure.

Of this scene the first thirty-four verses are Tetrameter Trochaics
Catalectic. The remainder consists of Trimeter Iambics.
