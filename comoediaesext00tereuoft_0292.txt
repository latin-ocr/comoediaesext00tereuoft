quence; and his “ honest dissimulation,’' as he himself calls it, is less
reconcilable to the philosophie turn of his. character, than to the
natural sensibility of Pamphilus. Besides that, the dissimulation of the
latter is palliated by his being almost involuntarily driven into it by the
artful instigations of Davus.

12. Ut ab illa excludar. ‘⁴ That Ι be divorced from Glycerium.'’
Comp. Eun. i. 1. 4 3 Tibull. ii. 3. 47. - Huc concludar. “ Shut up there
with Philumena-’⁵ [Pointing to his father's house, whither his wzfe was
to be conducted] Donatus says this alludes to the practice of shutting
y up wild beasts in a cage. Comp. Phorm. v. 1. 17.-14. Ducas volo.
Comp. ii. 5. 7. -- 15. Cedo, quid jurgabz't tecum ? “ Tell me, then, for
what shall he chide you ?” —Reddes onmia certa, &c. Comp. iii. 2.
23 3 Eun. iii. 5. 62 ; Hor. Sat. ii. 3. 167. - 17. Sine omni periclo.
“ Without any apprehension of your marrying Philumena.” Cicero,
as Ruhnken observes, would have said sine ullo periculo. — 18. Nec tu
ea causa minueris. “ Nor do you for that very reason be withdrawn
from your designs, nor make your visits less frequently to Glycerium.”
Literally: “ be not changed as to your daily pursuits.’' Comp. Hec.
iv. 3. 10. Ea causa. Because Chremes will not give you his daughter.
— 19. Haec, quae facis. Your visiting Glycerium. —Ne is mutet.
“ Lest Chremes change his determination.'’ — 21. Nam, quod tu speres.
‘⁶ For the hopes you entertain Ι will easily refute.’' Quod, that your
father shall not be able to find a wife for a person of such depraved
morals as you are. This passage is, I believe, universally understood
as I have now given it. It appears to me, notwithstanding, that
Terence intended it thus z—The hope that you entertain—i. e. that your
father, overcome by your entreaties, will ultimately consent to your
having Glycerium—I will easily refute. No man would give to his son
a wife of such infamous morals, as your father is persuaded she is. He
will rather find out, &c. Propuzsare is used for refellere. See Ovid, Met.
i. 759. - His moribus. ‘⁴ To one contaminated with such morals.” The
words his moribus are always taken in a bad sense. Comp. Sall. Jug. c.
4 ; Propert. iii. 12. 16; Quintil. v. 12. Perlet takes speres in the sense
of timeas, as in Cic. Rosc. Amer. c. 4. —— 22. Dabit nemo. “ No man
will give his daughter (uxorem) in marriage‚’¹ &c.--Inveniet. Non
aliquis is the same as nemo.- aliquis, therefore, is the nominative to
inveniet. ——— Inopem. “ Α poor son-in-law.’' —- Quam te corrumpi sinat.
‘¹ Rather than suffer her to be contaminated by you.” Here te is an

ablative. In this interpretation Ι have followed Reinhardt. The pas· ¹

sage is generally understood otherwise: “Your father will find out
some poor maiden to be your wife, rather than see you ruined with Gly-
cerium.'’ In this case te must be considered as an accusative. See
note on vs. 21. -— 23. Si accipiet. “ If your father shall learn that you
bear it patiently.’' — 24. Alia otiosus quoeret. “ He will devise some
other plans at his leisure.'’ This is the reading of all the MSS. and
most editions. Bentley reads from conjecture aliam .· ‘⁴ He will seek
out another match for you at his leisure.'’ —Alz'quid acciderit boni.
“Something lucky may turn up.'' Comp. ii. 1. 14. - 25. Vide quo me
inducas. “ See to* what you are leading me ;'’ or, “ Take care you do
not lead me into mischiefi'’ A metaphor from hunfing, in which wild
beasts are decoyed into the nets. Comp. i. 2. 9; Heaut. iv. 4. ];
Tibull. i. 6. — Quin taces! “Nay, peace !’' —26. Dicam. “Tben I

will tell him so.’'—Cautio est. For cavendum est: “You must take γ
