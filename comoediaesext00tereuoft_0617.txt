Excunsus 11. 579

by the division of a monochord, that two musical strings of the
same matter, thickness, and tensium one being but half the length of
the other, will be in octave. It is the same with two pipes: and the
appearance of the equal and unequal flutes in antique representations‚
seems to confirm the conjecture of their being unisons and octaves to
each etheum—Fam Comm’s Pnnmcn.

EXCURSUS ΙΙ.
ANDRIA, ii. 1. 1.-—Quid ais, Byrrhia, διο.

“The two characters of Charinus and Byrrhia were not in the works
of Menander, but were added to the fable by Terence, lest Philumena's
being left without a husband, on the marriage of Pamphilus to Gly-
cerium, should appear too tragica] a circumstance.”—Domrus.

Madame Dacier, after transcribing this remark, adds, that it ap-
pears to her to be an observation of great importance to the theatre,
and well worthy our attention. Important as this dramatic arcanum
may be, it were to be wished that Terence had never found it out, or,
at least, that he had not availed himself of it in the construction of the
Andria. It is plain'that the duplicity of the intrigue did not proceed
from the imitation of Menander, since these characters, on which the
double plot is founded, were not drawn from the Greek poet. Charinus
and Byrrhia are indeed but poor counterparts, or faint shadows, of
Pamphilus and Davus3 and instead os adding life and vigour to the
fable, rather damp its spirit, and stop the activity of its progress. As
to the tragica] circumstance of Philumena’s having no husband, it
seems something like the distress of Prince Prettyman, who thinks it
a matter of indifference, whether he shall appear to be the son of a
king or a fisherman, and is only uneasy lest he should be the son of
nobody at all. I am much more inclined to the opinion of an in-
genious French critic, Diderot‚ than to that of Donatus or Madame
Dacier. His comment on this underplot is as follows : ‘It is almost
impossible to conduct two intrigues at a time, without weakening the
interest of both. With what address has Terence interwoven the
amours of Pamphilus and Charinus in the Andria l But has he done
it without inconvenience? At the beginning of the second act, do
we not seem to be entering upon a new piece? and does the fifth con-
clude in a very interesting manner 2⁹

“ It is but justice to Sir Richard Steele to confess, that he has con-
duoted'the under-plot in the Con-scions Lovers in a much more artful
and interesting manner than Terence in the Andria. The part which
Myrtle sustains‚ though not wholly unexceptionable, especially in the
last act. is more essentia] to the fable. His character also is more
separated and distinguished from Bevil, than Charinus from Pam-
philus, and serves to produce one of the best scenes in the glay?
