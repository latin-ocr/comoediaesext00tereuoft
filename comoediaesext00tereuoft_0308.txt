— 3. Ut malis gaudeant. ‘⁴ As to rejoice in the misfortunes of othersl'
The nominative to gaudeant is implied in cuiquam. Quisque frequently
takes a plural verb. Comp. Sall. Cat. c. 37; Livy, ii. 22. - Atque ex
incommodis, διο. In Livy, iv. 58. we read, Ex incommodo alieno suam
occasionem petere. Comparare is put for the simple parare, ‘⁸ acquire.'’

14. Attamen, ubi fides? si roges. ‘⁴ But should you ask, what is
become of their broken saith? ’³ Ubi fides ? is a formula complaining
of perfidy. Comp. Heaut. ii. 3. 153 Ovid, Epist. vi. 41. —Non
pudent hic, ubi opus ἐι. “They are not concerned in the least where
they ought to be.” Pudent an antiquated personal verb. When a
promise is aske'd of them they are ashamed to refuse, and this is the
time when they ought not to be ashamed; for we may boldly refuse
another what cannot be granted without an inconvenience to ourselves.
But when the time comes that they ought to make good their promises,
they are not ashamed of breaking theirv word3 and it is then, if ever,
that they ought to be ashamed. Here Terence has imitated Plautus,
Epid. ii. 1. 1.— 16. Expostulem. ‘⁴ Reproach him with, this injury.''
Expostulare signifies ‘⁴ to argue with a person who has committed an
