terror of Laches, says Donatus, accounts for his sudden consent
to the union of Chaerea and Pamphila: for though he could not
settle the matter entirely with credit, yet he was glad to find his
son had made an equal match, rather than endangered his life. On
this Colman observes, that Chaerea apologizes still better for this
arrangement in the scene with Thais, (v. 2. 50, 51‚) where he says he
is confident of obtaining his father’s consent, provided Pamphila prove
to be a citizen. Indeed the match between them is rather a reparation '
of an injury done to her, than a degradation of himself.

ACT V. Scmm VI.

Pythias had not yet taken her full revenge on Parmeno3 she is still
resolved to torment him further, and for that purpose owns the trick
she had just now put upon him: she adds, that since he had been
discovered both as the adviser and betrayer of the plot, both father and
son had united against him, in a desire of taking vengeance. When
Parmeno, provoked at this insult, threatens a severe revenge, she only
laughs at him, and leaves him, as one whose threats she knew could
not affect her.

This scene consists of Tetrameter Iambics Catalectic.
