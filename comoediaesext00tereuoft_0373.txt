captain? by Thais? or by the wine? Perlet answers: By the wine?

both a true and natural description of the effects of drinking. And
that Chremes, who had probably never exceeded in this way before,
seemed surprised at what was unusual to him, is well imagined by the
poet. Comp. Lucr. iii. 47 5. —4. Formosior. For to an inebriated person

ACT IV. 8anss VI.

Thais returns from the captain after the quarrel; and as they had
parted without being reconeiled, she foresees he will come to force
Pamphila from her. She resolves, however, to withstand all his
threats, and being in the mean time accosted by Chremes, commu-
nieates the whole matter to him, that by his aid she may be the
better enabled to make good her defence. As this rustic is not
much used to encounters of this nature, she finds it a very trouble-
some task to persuade and prepare him for the onset; but at last

revails.

frequently construed with a dative, as in Cic. ad Div. ii. 37; Plaut.
