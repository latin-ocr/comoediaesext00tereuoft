CHARLES ΑΝΤΗοΝ, LL.D.

*s* The present edition of Cicero contains the Four Orations wasme camin,
together with those for A rctzias, Marcellus, the M unilirm Low, and Murena. Tine
editor has based his text on that of Ernesti ς but whenever a reading retentae
itself calculated to throw more light on the author's meaning, he has not euitat&
to adopt it. The Commentary, which is very copious, is upon the plan of the
Professor's previous publications. The train of thought is continually laid open
to the young scholar, so as to enable him to appreciate in their full force aud
beauty, these brilliant memorials of other days ; and the allusions, in which th
orator is so fond of indulging, are caresully and fully explained. ·

Q. HORATII FLACCI OPERA OMNIA, ex recensione F. G.
DomuNG. With English Notes, by CHARLES Arrrnors, LL.D.

*a* The merits of this edition of Horace have been already acknowledged by
its introduction into several of our most eminent schools. To the text of Diiring,
now universally received at home and amaad, are subj0ined the notes of Professor
Anthon. At once concise and full, they form a running commentary on the
writings of Horace, and are equally adapted, by their clearness„to the hemana,
and by their comprehensive fulness, to the mature scholar. ··

βξ· The attention of Masters of Schools is respectfully invited to
the above editions of the me CLAssms, in which an attempt has
been made to combine cheapness with eleganoe. So great has been
the care bestowed upon the labours of the press, that, independent of
the great value of Professor Anthon's masterly annotations, the Pub-
lisher confidently anticipates they will prove the most accurate School

Classics ever produced in England.
