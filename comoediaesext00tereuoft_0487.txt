ACT IV. Semta IV.

We here find AEschinus represented in a very different light from
what he has appeared in former soenes. There he is a rake ; here he
is a lover, full of tenderness. There is nothing more instructing than
this diversity of character in the same person, when justly represented;
as it serves more immediately to guide us through all the mazes and
windings of the human heart, and show the different shapes men are
apt to appear in, according to the several passions they are actuated
by, and their different degrees of prevalence. Here the heart of
AEsehinus is laid open, and he appears not in a counterfeit light, as
formerly, but in his native colours. He had learned from the nurse,
whom he accidentally met as she was going for the midwife‚ the
suspicion he lay under to Sostrata, and the grounds of it. This
perplexes him extremely. He is anxious to make them easy, and
vindicate himself, but is at a loss how to do it. To inform them of
the whole matter, as it really is, would expose his brother, whose story
he is unwilling to make known to any person: and should he confide
it to their prudence, there are so many probable circumstances against
him, that it is doubtful how far they would believe him. He therefore
determines to acquaint his father with the situation he is in, and beg
Pamphila in marriage; for by this proof of his sincerity, he knows he
shall remove all their scruples at once, and, moreover, complete his
own wishes. ’
