“ Considering the condition of slaves.'’ Comp. Caes. B. G. iv. 3.
We ought to observe here, that slaves among the ancients were but
meanly thought of, nor was much regard paid to their testimony. This
is the reason why Hegio is so particular in describing Geta's good
qualities. — 36. Quaere rem. ‘⁴ Force the truth from him by torture.”

Servius on Virg. AEn. viii. 127.

4⁴7. Defendam. Comp. Andr. iv. 5. 18. - 49. Militiae et domi. “ In
war and peace.'’ - 50. Paupertatem. There is nothing that more power-
fully links men together, than to be eompanions in adversity. The

heart is then at liberty to give full scope to all its interest, feelings,
and emotions; and as there are no embarrassments, no avocations of
pleasure to entangle it, it is glad to lay hold on those consolations
which it possesses within itself. — 52. Animam relinquam. Comp. Heaut.
iii. 1. 70. —54. Is, quod mihi, &a Madame Dacier rejects this line,
because it is also to be found in the Phormio. But it is no uncommon
thing with our author to use the same expression or verse in different
places, especially on familiar occasions. There is no impropriety in
it here, and the soregoing hemistich is rather lame without it. The
propriety of consulting Micio, or·Demea's present ill-humour with
him, are of no consequence. The old man is surprised at Hegio’s
story, does not know what to do or say, and means to evade giving a
positive answer, by saying that he will consult his brother.-—55.
Cum animo cogite& Cicero, (Agr. ii. 24‚) also inserts the preposition.
56. Quam vos facillume . . . tam, διο. “ The more you live at ease3
the more your power, your wealth‚ your riches, and nobility3 the
more it is your duty to act honourably.'’ The use of the partiales quam,
tam with superlative& is remarkable. Comp. Heaut. v. 2. 44; see
Sanct. Min. iv. 4. -— 60. Redito. “ Go to.” — 61. Duc meintm.
Comp. Heaut. iii. 1. 23. [Exit Hegio with Geta.]

62. Non me, διο. [Demea alone :] “This is no more than I fore÷
told.’' Indicente here is the same as non dicente. This, as Donatus
observes, is an expression harsh and unusual 3 but it comes very aptly
from a man in anger. — Utinam hic sit, Sco. “ Ι wish from my soul
