circumspicimus praesentia, prospicimus futura. Comp. Andr. ii. 2. 20.
Micio endeavours to recall matters to the recollection of AEsehinus, in
the same manner as Chremes awakens the memory of Sostrata, Heaut.

“ Mock you? I? wherefore? '³ Donatus has a remark upon this
passage, too beautiful to be omitted. Micio answers his son here, as
if he were surprised how he should suspect him to be capable of
bantering him in so serious an affair. This, perhaps, may startle the
reader, who will be apt to call to mind the story of the Milesian.
The solution given of this difficulty, by the above-named critic, is
extremely judicious, and may be admitted as an indisputable maxim in
morals. It is allowable‚ he says, to banter a person we love, by
raising false alarms, when we have it in our power to dissipate these
fears in a moment, and to fill them with real joy. But it is a deceitful
and cruel part to fill one with imaginary joys, when we foresee that
sadness and sorrow are likely to eume—64. Nisi tam misere, διο.
“ Unless that I so exceedingly desire it may be true.’' Thus Pam-
philus, Andr. iv. l. 40.

7. 16. -69, Periit. “He has vanished.'’ —70. Tu Deos potius
comprecare. Terence has found the art of making AEschinus praise
his father, without offending delicacy. Religion furnishes him with
the opportunity of a panegyrim and in excusing himself from ad—
dressing the gods in the present case, he finds a natural occasion of
bestowing on his father, in a few words, the finest commendation that
could possibly be given him. Comp. Virg. AEn. ii. 717.—-7 1. Obtem-
peraturos. For exaudituros tuas preces ,· “ they will hear your prayers-’⁹
