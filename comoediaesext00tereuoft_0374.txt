9. Hem! [With concern‚] “ Hah !’' Chremes, upon hearing
Thais speak of restoring his sister, asks, with impatience‚ where she is;
and upon hearing that she is at her house, expresses himself, as here
quoted, hastily, and with an air of concern3 for that we are here to
consider hem ! as an interjection of grief and trouble, is evident from
Thais's answer. Chremes is concerned to think that his sister is at
the house of a courtezan, as concluding that her morals must, ’before
this time, have been debauched. Thais, to remove this apprehension,
assures him that she had been well educated, and will do him no dis-
honour.— 10. Id quod res est. “The fact as it really is; the very

This alludes to the custom of the ancients of attaching some valuable ,
token to their children, by which they might be recognised if stolen in
their infancy. When they exposed their children, they also left with
them some pledge of value, that they might not be altogether destitute.
These pledges were called γνωρίσματα by the Greeks, and crepundia by
the Romans. The monumenta here meant were, probably, the dress
and ornaments on the person of Pamphila, when carried off by the

irates.
