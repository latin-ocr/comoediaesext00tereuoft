17. Ez' here is a spondee. — 13. Cavit. ‘⁴ He took care.'’ Cavere is ’

14. Virum fortem. This is not to be interpreted “a brave '' or
‘⁴ courageous man’' here, but “ a discreet, prudent man‚’' a man of
spirit and honour, who values his reputation. So fortissamiliae, “ of an

“ He says you scarcely expended ten drachmae in catering.'’ Comp.
Plaut. Aul. ii. 4. 15. The common reading is opsonatus, which some ἰ
consider as a substantive: “The catering, he says, is scarcely of ten =

1 drachmae.'' Thus Colman: “ A feast of scarce ten drachms! Does ξ
