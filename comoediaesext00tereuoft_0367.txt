conversation with him. The captain, alarmed at this, as imagining
him a rival brought in on purpose to affront him, to mortify Thais in
his turn, remembering the advice given him by Gnatho, orders Pam-
phila to be sent for. This occasions a quarrel‚ which being likely
to run high, Thais privately pulls off her jewels, and gives them to her
maid to carry home, intending to withdraw as soon as possible. Dorias,
therefore, appears here upon the stage with her mistress’s jewels, and
as she is going home, aequaints the spectators with what has happened
at the ca tain’s.

Of thiIsj scene, vss. 1, 4, 5, 6, are Tetrameter Trochaics Acatalectic,
of which vs. 1 has a Tribrach in the last place ; vss. 3 and 8, Tetra-
meter Iambics Acatalectic; and vss. 2, 7, 9—14, Tetrameter Trochaics
Catalectic.

1. Ita me Di ament. [Enter Dorias, with a caslcet quewels.] Dryden,
in his Essay on Dramatic Poetry, has the following remark: —“ ’Tis
true the ancients have kept the continuity of soenes somewhat better
than the moderns. Two do not perpetually come in together, talk,
and go out together; and other two succeed them, and do the same
throughout the act, which the English call by the names of single
scenes 3 but the reason is, because they have seldom above two or three
soenes, properly so called, in every act ς for it is to be accounted a new
scene, not only every time the stage is empty, but every person who
enters, though to others, makes it so, because he introduces a new
business. Now the plots of their plays being narrow, and the persons
few, one of their acts is written in less compass than one of our well-
wrought soenes 3 and yet they are often deficient even in this. To go
no further than Terence, you find, in the Eunuch, Antipho entering
singly in the midst of the third act, after Chremes and Pythias were
gone offi In the same play you have likewise Dorias beginning the
fourth act alone ; and after she has made a relation of what was done at
the captain's entertainment, (which by the way was very inartificial,
because she was presumed to speak directly to the audience, and to
aequaint them with what was necessary to be known; but yet should
have been so contrived by the poet as to have been told by persons of
the drama to one another, and so by them to have come to the know-
ledge of the people ς) she quits the stage, and Phaedria enters next,
alone likewise. He also gives you an account of himself, and of his
returning from the country, in monologue ; to which unnatural way of
narration Terence is subject in all his plays. In his Adelphi, Syrus
and Demea enter, after the scene is broken by the departure of Sostrata,
Geta, and Canthara: and indeed you can scarcely look into any of his
comedies, where you will not presently discover the same interruption.’'
f- Ita me Di ament is a formula of swearing. Comp. Cic. ad Div. x. 9.

2. Ne quam. For ne aliquam. The verb in this verse is taken
in a double sense ε facere turbam signifies “ to cause a disturbance ;’'
facere vim, “ to offer violence.” —- 4. Militem rogat. “ Thais requests
of the captain.” —- Irasci. For irascebatur. So next verse, audere
for audebat, and instare for instabat. — 5. Instare, ut. “ Persisted in
requesting him to invite Chremes.” Comp. Livy, ii. 4. — 6. Quia
illa, διο. constr. Quia non tempus erat ad eam rem, scilicet indicare
illa de sorore ejus quae cupiebat. — 8. Invitat tristis. “ Thraso in an
ill humour invites him.” -- Ibi. For tum. — 9. Patare. For putabat.
—- 10. Facere. He pursues the advice given him by Gnatho, iii. Ι.
