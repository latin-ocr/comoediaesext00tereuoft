ACT ΙΙΙ. Semi: I.

Pamphilus is now arrived, and informed of what has happened in his
absence. As the real reason of his wise's leaving the house is un-
known, he too imputes it to the same cause with the rest, some differ-
ence between her and his mother. This appears to him to be a
misfortune beyond all others, because, whatever he resolves on, he
foresees unavoidable misery to himself. His character, indeed, is
amiable beyond example. He is fond of and loves his wife, and the
thought of parting with her torments him cruelly. He is also a dutifuJ
son, and, though urged by such powerful passions, cannot resolve upon
any thing inconsistent with the respect he owes his mother. This
distraction and uncertainty is the cause of his complaints in the begin-
ning of this scene, and leads him into a long train of reflections upon
his ill success and unhappiness in love. He was compelled to marry
when his affections were engaged elsewhere, nor did he find it an easy
matter to withdraw them from the person when they had taken such
deep root. And now that he had at last settled-them upon his wife,
and began to be happy in her society, and mutual tenderness, so a new
stroke of adverse fortune threatens to tear him from her too. Par-
meno endeavours to soothe him with the hope, that it may, perhaps,
be no more than a mere trifle, which he will find it easy to compose and
settle. While they are thus discoursing together, by some hux-ry and
trepidation heard in ‘the house, Pamphilus learns that his wife had been
out of order, and impatiently rushes in to know what is the matter.

Of this scene, verses 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, and 37, are Tetrameter Tro-
ehaics Catalectic; vs8. 1, 4, 9, 10, 11, Tetrameter Trochaics Acata-
lectic; vs. 45, a Tetrameter Iambic Catalectic ; and vss. 47-55‚
Trimeter Iambics. All the remaining verses are Tetrameter Iambics
Acatalectic.

1. Nemini. Donatus has very well observed, that the first verses of
this scene were too sublime, and the complaints of Pamphilus more
suited to tragedy than comedy‚ but for the addition of ex amore ‚-
which corrects all, and gives the whole speech a natural and consistent
