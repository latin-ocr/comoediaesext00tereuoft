402 HEAUTON TIMORUMENos.

Heinsius arranges the passage in the following manner ε

Cn. Ea res nunc ayitur ipsa. ΜΕ. Quid dixti, Chreme?
Erravi. Sic res acta est, quanta de spe decidi!

Cn. Immo hoec quidem, quoe apud te est, Clitiphonis est
Amica. ME. Ita aiunt. Ca. Et tu cre’dis 2 Mn. omnia.

Madame Dacier proposed:

Cu. Ea res nunc aqitur ipsa. ME. Quid dixti, Chreme ἵ
CH. Immo hoec quidem, quoe apud te est, Clitiphonis est
Amica. ME. Ita aiunt. cn. Et tu credis? Mn. Omnia.

Westerhovius reads ε

Cn. Ea res nunc ayiiur ipsa. ME. Quid dixti, Chreme ?
Erravi‚ sic res acta est .· quanta de spe decidi !

Immo, lzoec quidem quoe apud me est, Clitiphonis eet
Amica. Ita aiunt. Cn. Et tu eredis? ΜΕ.. Omnia.

The verse, Erravi, sic, διο. is wanting in Vatican MS.; also in the
codex Bembinus, and some of the earliest editions. Faernus, Bentley,-
and the Bipont editors, have consequently expunged it. See ii. 3. 9.

13. Et illam aiant, &c. “ And they say, too, he wants to marry her:
that, soon as I have consented, you may give him money,’' διο. Illam.
Bacchis. — Desponderim. Comp. iv. 5. 31. —- 14. Compar-ct. Comp. iv.
5. 30. — 15. Id est prqfecto. Menedemus is here at length convinced
that Chremes had judged right of his son's disposition. And, indeed,
putting together all that had been concerted between them, and com-
paring them with circumstances as they now offered, it was impossible
not to come into this notion, appearances were so strong for it.
Menedemus, who is not here distinguished sor his penetration, but
represented as a man of plain sense, would have acted quite out of
character, not to be determined by reasons so probable.--Amicoe.,
‘⁴ To Bacchis.'’ — Scilicet, &c. “ Be assured it will be given.’' — 16.
Ah! frustra, διο. “ Alas! my transports are all groundless, then.'’
— 17. Quidvis tamen, διο. Comp. iii. 1. 56.

20. Indulges. Comp. i. 1. 99.-21. Perfice hoc, διο. “As you
have already begun to aid and advise me, continue your good offices-;
make thern lasting and perpetual.’'--Perpetuo. For in perpetuum,-
G. Fabricius reads perpetuum.—-— 22. Dic convenisse. ‘⁴ Say that we
have met.” This verb sometimes signifies ‘⁴ to agree '’ to any thing. --· ’
25. Desponsam. “ That my daughter is betrothed to him.” —— 26. Ut ,ς
poscat. Supply argentum. The verb poscere is construed with two, Α
accusatives, one of the person, and another of the thing. Comp. Livy,

f i. 24«. — 27. Nae. For valde. —— 28. Ut istam rem video. ‘⁴ As far as Ι

5 can judge.’' -— Istius obsaturabere. “ You will be heartily weary of
¹ him.” Comp. Plaut. Stich. i. 1. 17. —29. Haec utut sunt. “Be those
things as they may.” - 30. Si sapies. Here we have a succession of ⁴

futures. ——- 32. Te sczentem faciam. “ I will let you know! '’ Comp. Andr.
iii. 2. 28. [Exeunt severallgs. ]

 

ACT V. Serme I.

Menedemus is by this time convinced, from unavoidable eircum- .:
stances, that Bacchis was not a pretended mistress of Clitipho, but so ἰ
in reality. Menedemus had conceived highly of Chremes, as a man of J
