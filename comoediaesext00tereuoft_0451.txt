NOTES ON= THE ADELPHI.

Annu‘m. Ἀδελφοί. “The Brothers.“ This comedy takes its name
{rom the two opposite characters, Micio and Demea. Some think the
name is derived from the brotherly love of AEschinus towards Ctesipho.

Lums Funnnmmxs. The Ludi Funebres were games instituted iu
honour of the dead; such as, according to Homer, were celebrated by
Achilles in honour of Patroclus ; and such as Virgil describes as having
been exhibited by AEneas in memory of his father Anchises, AEn. v.
72, seqq. — AEMILII PAULI. Lucius AEmilius Paulus, surnamed
Macedonicus, because he had obtained a victory over Perseus, king of
Macedon. He died in the year of Rome 593, and was so poor at that
time, that his friends were constrained to sell his estate in order to pay
his widow her dowry.—Q. FAmus MAxmth, P. Consanus Armenius.
Some editions add AEdilibus curulibus, but erroneously‚ as Scaliger
and the other commentators think; for the children and relations of
the deceased, and not the AEdiles, had always the direction of the
funeral garnes. Besides, it is very certain that P. C. Scipio Africanus,
the son of Paulus AEmffius, never was aedile, the consulship having
been conferred upon him the same year that he sued for the aedileship‚
though not yet arrived at the usual age assigned for that high dignsty,
as we are told by Aurelius Victor, in his little Treatz‘se qs Illustrious
Men. And this event did not happen till twelve years after the death
of his father, and the representation of this play, Scipio being

“ then but thirty-six years of age, before which time no person could

be elected aedile. Muretus found the correct reading in an ancient
MS. at Venice. The Q. Fabius Maximus and P. Cornelius Africanus
here mentioned were the sons of AEmilius Paulus, and had taken the
surnames of the persons who adopted them. The aediles in that year
were Q. Fulvius Nobilior and L. Marcius.

Tmns SARRANIS. For Sarrane or Tyrian flutes, which having a
grave sound‚ suited the present occasion. See notes on the Insciption
of the Andria. Τὴε description of the flutes given there renders
Madame Dacier’s emendation nugatory, that lady having proposed
acta primum tibiis Lydiae, deinde tibiis Sarranis. Tyre was called Sor
by the ancient Phoenicians3 the Carthaginians and their descendants
called it Sar. Whence it was afterwards called Sarra. - MENANDRU.
