ACT V. ScsNE IV.

Here Antipho again makes his appearance, reflecting on the
different situation of his own affairs from those of his friend Phaedria.
He rejoices at his friend·s success but cannot avoid repining at his own
fate, in having thus subjected him to misfortunes‚ that he found it so
difficult to extricate himself from. However, he comforts himself in
the best manner he can, with the small hopes that still· remain of his
being able to get the better of all these threatening disasters.

This scene consists of Tetrameter Iambics Catalectic.
