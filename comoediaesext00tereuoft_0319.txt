Daeier observes, that it appears from Xenophon (de Repub. Athen. ), ‚

that all the inhabitants of cities and islands in alliance with Athens
were obliged, in all claims, to repair thither, and refer their cause to
the decision of the people, not being permitted to plead elsewhere.
We cannot wonder, then, that Crito is unwilling to engage in a suit so
inconvenient from its length, expense, and little prospect of success.
