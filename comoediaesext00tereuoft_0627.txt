which made it the interest of the actors to support the piece, as the
loss, if it was rejected, fell upon themselves.-— This, it must be owned,
is ingenious, but has nothing to support it but conjecture. We are
entirely unacquainted with the nature of these transactions between
the aediles, players, and poet, and therefore cannot pronounce with
‘certainty about them. Besides, Ι believe it will be hard to find an
instance where pretium is put for aestimatio pretii .- Ι am therefore more
inclined to think that on some occasions the aediles, and on others the
master of the company, bought the play, of which last kind was the
purchase of the Hecyra. But how, in either case, if it was not received
by the public, the poet could claim a right to the second sale, as is
mentioned in the first prologue, is a matter not easily determined at
this distance of timeam—Fumea

“ Madame Dacier’s reasoning on this dark point of theatrical
history is certainly inconclusive, not only for want of proof, but be-
cause no method of settling the assize of plays could be more unworthy
the magistrate, more detrimental to authors, or more hurtful to the
credit of the stage; for if the actor was to abide by the loss, his
interest would incline him to set the very lowest value on the piece.·——
Taking the whole prologue together, may not one conjecture that the
first time a play was exhibited, it was purchased, as is mentioned in
other prologues, by the aediles; but if it failed, or, for the sake of
gladiators and rope-dancers, was then refused a hearing, the poet had a
right to withdraw his piece without returning the copy-money 3 and if
it was brought on again by the man-ager, it was at his own hazard and
expense? This conjecture explains the passage in the first prologue
concerning a second sale, and gives an additional force to every thing
urged by Ambivius in the second; in which, supposing the actor to be
speaking to the audience concerning a theatrical usage with which
they were all familiarly aequainted‚ the whole obscurity of both the
prologues vanishes. We immediately comprehend the manner of his
revival of the plays of Caecilius, and see how essentially his interest is
concerned in the representation of this of Terence. It gives us also
a very high opinion of the penetration and humanity of Ambivius.’'—

EXCURSUS X.

HEcYRA, iii. 3. l. —- Nequeo mearum rerum, διο.

“It is observed by the Rev. Dr. J oseph Warton‚ in his judicious
critical papers in the Adventmer, that ‘ Terence superabounds in solilo-
quies; and that nothing can be more inartificial, or improper, than the
manner in which he has introduced them:' and we may add to this
iffiservation, that there is no play of Terence in which he has so
much transgressed that way, as in the Hecyra. The present long
soliloquy is a most flagrant instance of want of art and propriety.
There are in it many affecting touches, and it informs us, at a proper
period, of a very important part of the sable; though Mons. Diderot
thinks that the return of Pamphilus would have been infinitely more
interesting, if this discovery had been made before. The same inge-
nious French writer lays it down as a rule, without exception, that a
soliloquy is an interval of repose in the action, and of agitation in the
character. This rule, 1 believe, ought to be most commonly observed.
