25. Epidicazomenen. Ἐπιδικαζομένην. Apollodorus wrote a comedy
so called from the young girl, who was the subject of a law suit.
Ἐπιδικαζόμενος, in the passive, signifies that concerning which a suit
had been commenced, and the judge had decided3 but ἑπιδικαζόμενος,
inthe middle voice, signifies the person who brings the suit; for he is
said ἐπιδικάζεσθαι. Some read here Epidicazomenon, meaning Phormio,
the plaintiff in Terenoe’s play. But the comedy called Epidicazomenos χ
was not written by Apollodorus, but by Philemon. Terence named
his play, not after Phanium, the ἐπιδικαζομένη of the piece, but after
Phormio, the parasite, “ because ’tis he who acts the chief part in the
plot.” ·— 29. Voluntas “ Favour‚'' or “encouragement.” Comp.

Geta had requested of Davus to let him have a trifle of money, which
he owed him. Davus here brings it; and as he had heard that Geta’s
young master was lately married, he naturally enough conjectures that
it was intended as a present for the bride. This leads him into several
beautiful reflections upon the inequality of the lot of man, till by the
appearance of Geta he is interrupted.

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.
