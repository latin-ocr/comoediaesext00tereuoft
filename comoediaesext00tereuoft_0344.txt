Essay on Dramatic Poetry, has this remark: “ When Phaedria in the
Eanueh had a command from his mistress to be absent two days, and
encouraging himself to go through with it, said Tandem ego non illa
caream, si opus sit, vel totum triduum ,Ρ Parmeno, to mock the softness
of his master, lifting up his hands and eyes, eries out, as it were in admi-
ration, Hui! universum triduum ! the elegancy of which universum,
though it cannot be rendered in our language, yet leaves an impression
on our minds. But this happens seldom in him, in Plautus oftenen
who is infinitely too bold in his metaphors and coining of words3 out of
which many times his wit is nothing.”—- 18. Vide quid agas. “ consider
how you act.'' ‘⁴ Take care what you are about.’' A formula, caution-
ing a person not to undertake an affair which he cannot accomplish.

Phaedria is gone, reflecting with himself upon what he had observed
in his master. He had known him a man of spirit, prudence, andfim
ness3 apt to give in to none of the follies and rash projects of other
young men of the like age. He sees him now all irresolution and
inconstancy, never continuing a moment in the same mind3 and this
entirely owing to his passion for Thais. He had therefore reason to
eall love a disease, which could produce so sudden a change in the
temper, and so totally enfeeble and unman the soul. Comp. Andr. i.

ACT II. SGENE ΙΙ.

Towards the end of the last scene, as Parmeno is wondering with
himself at the sudden change which love had occasioned in his master,
he sees Gnatho, the captain's parasite, coming up at some distance,
and bringing along with him Pamphila, as a present for Thais. Tlus
