Quid tu es tristis? Comp. Eun. ii. 3. 13. The poet very happily in
this place expresses the carelessness and security of one inebriated.
Syrus discovers no sear at the approach of the old man, as in former
soenes. He has no forethought‚ no apprehension of danger, but is
quite lulled into ease and indolence.

Sapientia. For sapientissime. This is the title under which he ad-

ACT V. *SCENE ΙΙ.

The poet still contrives to heap fresh troubles upon Demea. His
brother, notwithstanding all his remonstrances, is irreclaimable; he.
is refiecting upon the ruin that threatened his brother’s family, when,
as an additional proof of it, Syrus comes out intoxicated3 and now, to
complete his misfortunes, he learns, by the unseasonable appearance
of Dromo, that his favourite son, Ctesipho, makes one of the revelling
company within. Thus has the poet contrived to raise his passion by
several gradations to the highest pitch, till, finding it uneasy to him-
self, and of no manner of purpose, he at last embraces the mild and
easy tem er.

The mletre of this scene is Trimeter Iambic.
