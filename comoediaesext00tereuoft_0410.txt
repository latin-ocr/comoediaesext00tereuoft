Gram. i. p. 89.—47. Quae ornantur sibi. “And dressed like those
who dress only for themselves.’' —48. Malam. The singular for the
plural, malas : “ Her cheeks not varnished with any female dye.'' The
accusative depends on offendimus, vs. 44. The common reading is,
Nulla mala re esse expolitam. Bentley conjectured, Nulla mala re inter—

read passus, as in Virg. AEn. i. 480. Comp. Hor. Sat. i. 8. 23; Ovid,
Met. i. 497. — Prolixus. Bentley reads promissus. But see Heinsius
on Virg. Ecl. viii. 34; and the interpreters on Livy, ii. 23; v. 41. --
50. Pam! A comic interjection: “Peace!” [Addressed to Clinia,
wlco, in the greatest impatience, is about to inter-rapt Syrna] Some
think it signifies that “ all was hush’' in the dwelling of Antiphila.

52. Subtemen. ‘⁴ The woof,'’ which is shot across the warp with the
shuttle. Comp. Ovid, Met. vi. 56.—-53. Pannis obsita. “All over

συνύφαινε ῥυπαρῶς διακειμένη. These lines are found in Victorius, Var.
Lect. ix. 15. He copied them from a Terence which belonged to
Politian, who had written them in the margin. Supposing the lines in
question to be genuine, may we not fairly conclude that all 'this fine
narration is a very close imitation of Menander, as well as that other
beautiful one which opens the first act. — 54. Neglecta, immunda
illuvie. “Sluttish, and begrimed with filth.” Comp. Virg. AEn. iii.
216.—56. sordidatam et sordidam. “Ragged and filthy.'’ Comp.
Cic. Pis. c. 4. —— 58. Internuntii. “ Confidents.” The meaning is, if

her servant had been a ‘⁴ go-between,'’ she wouldnot have been so neg-
lected. Colman renders it,

‘¹ A sign the mistress leads a blameless life .
When she maintains no flaunting go-between.”

in her lover’s absence, and that it had been agreeable to the stiictast
rules of innocence and decency. It now remains, that we be informed
how she stood affected to Clinia; and whether her, attachment here
was still the same as formerly. This Syrus makes appear by her
manner of behaving when hewas named to her, and so makes good
what he had advanced to Clinia in the beginning, vs. 24. — 64. Telum

here as a monosyllable.--Desiderio tuo. “For love of thee.'' See
