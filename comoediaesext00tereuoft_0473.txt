Aer 111. scens 11. 435

Eurip. Phoen. vs- 858. — Prorsus. Nothing can exceed the justness
aad masterly strokes of this description. Geta, when he comes to
acquaint his mistress with the missortune that had befallen her, as he
knew how much pain it must give her, finds himself almost deprived of
the power of speech. He is too much shocked to be able to express
himself any otherwise than in single words, or broken and interrupted
sentences. —2⁷. Actum ἐι. Comp. Andr. iii. l. 7. -28, Alienus.
Comp. Hec. iv. 4. 36.

30. Neque id occulte fert. “ Nor does he conceal it.'' Occulteserre
is the same as dissimulare. The opposite is palam, or aperte ferre,
“to do any thing openly.” Comp. Livy, ii. 54. -Ab lenone. For
lenoni. Comp. Cic. pro Marcello, c. lo.-- 31. Hisce oculis. Comp.

nus‘tffl There is a particular emphasis and beauty in the addition
of nostrum. This single word assembles a crowd of tender ideas.
Shakespeare, whose works contain examples of every species of beauty
in poeti-y, affords us a very elegant instance of this irregular manner,
which, addressing itself to the passions, affeets us more sensibly than
set forms of speech. The turn of phrase, in which Desdemona pleads
for Cassio, is a good deal similar to the way in which Sostrata here

speaks of AEschinus.

his father’s lap.’' The Greeks, as soon as they had a child born, imme-
diately put it on the grandfather's knee, if he were living. Phoenix, in
the ninth Iliad, says, that his father loaded him with curses, and invoked

‘⁴ My father, soon possessed
with strong suspicion of the fact, let loose
A storm of imprecation, in his rage
Invoking all the Furien to forbid
That ever son of mine should press his knees.''
Cowper’s Iliad, ix. 556.

This custom did not prevail among the Romans: our author, not-
withstanding, as he translated his play from the Greek, judieiously
preserves that usage—Sui patris. “ Of his adopted father‚” Micio.
