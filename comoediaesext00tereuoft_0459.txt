reason he suppresses part of the truth; and, in telling Micio what he
had done, says in oedes irruit alienas, which makes the offence appear
very heinous3 whereas, had he told it plainly as it was, in cedes irruit
lenonis, he knew his brother would have laughed at it as a trifle. See
the commentators on Hor. od. i. 25. 1. - 9. Dominum. He should in
truth have said lenonem. —- Familiam. For scortorum gregem. Comp.
Heaut. iv. 5. 3.-10. Mulcavit. ‘⁶ Beat.'’ Usque ad mortem is added in
order to exaggerate. - 12. Hoc. A pronoun. Rivius considers it an
adverb. In the edition of 1469 it is joined to factum esse. — 13. In ore
'st omni populo. ‘⁴ It is in every one’s mouth-⁸ So sermo 0nmibus erat
inore, Cic. Loel. c. 1. —Non fratrem videt. There is much humour in
this passage, as it appears that the son so much commended is the
most in fault. — 15. Rei operam dare. Supply familiaris augendae .- “ Is
intent on the increase of his fortune.'’ Comp. Heaut. v. 1. 67; Cic.
Rosc. Amer. c. 15. — 16. Nullum hujus factum simile. These words are
supposed to -be spoken with vehemence‚ and an air of indignation
against the other, who was so unlike this example of sobriety. —— Illi.
For in illum .· “against AEschinus.'' So tibi for in te. Comp. Plaut.
Trin. ii. 2. 61; Phaedr. iv. 19. 18.-17. Illum, Sto. Comp. Andr. ii. 3. 22.

18. Imperito. ‘⁴ Inexperienced’' in the practice of the world. Me-
nander: Οὐκ ἔστ’ ἀνοίας οὐδὲν, ὡς ἐμοὶ δοκεῖ, τολμηρότερον. - 20. Quorsum
istuc ? Supply pertinet, or dicis. — 21. Non est flagitium. Micio seems
here to carry his indulgence too far3 but we are to reflect, that it is
more to oppose Demea’s surliness,than from any real approbation of his
son’s follies, that he speaks in this manner ε for towards the end of the
scene he owns that he is not a little concerned for this late behaviour
of AEschinus, who carried his extravagances rather too far. Comp. Ean.

-ii. 3. 91. Micio, says Donatus, does not deny that all this is wrong, but
he contends that it is not flagitium. — 22. Non est. There is much force
and elegance in this repetition. Comp. Phorm. ii. 3. 723 Cic. Syll. c. 27 ;
Livy, xxx. 14. Bothe reads non est? neque sores effringere? interroga-
tively‚ and gives them to Demea. —·— 24. Non siit egestas. “ It was our
poverty that prevented us.’' Siit for sivit. — Tibi id laudi duces. ‘⁶ Will
you claim a merit to yourself, from that which want constrained you to.''
See note on Prol. v. 5.—26. Injurium ἐι. “ It is unfair.'’-—Fieret. The
first syllable is long. Comp. Heaut. v. 4. ]4; Plaut. Amph. i. 2. 25. —
Esset. For fuisset. So faceremus, next verse, for fecissemus. - 27. Si esses
homo. “ If you were a wise and prudent man.'’ Comp. iv. 2. 40. See
Ruhnken on Rutil. Lup. ii. 114. Some interpret it si esses humanus, non
tyrannus.— 28. Per aetatem. Comp. Eun. i. 2. 33. The contrary is praeter
(etatem. Comp. Heaut. i. 1. 7. - Facere potius quam faceret. See
note on Andr. iv. 5. 3. — 29. Ubi te expectatum, διο. “ When, after
wishing long, he shall at last get rid of you.’' Expectatum, “having
long wished for your death.'’ Comp. v. 4. 5. Ejecissetsoras. “ Sud-
denly carried you to the tomb.”-30. Alieniore aetate. “ At an age
when they will less become him.’'

31. Pro Jupiter. A tragic exclamation. ——Homo. [In anger and in-
dignativa :] “ Man, you drive me to madness.” Comp. Eun. ii. 2. 8. —-
33. Ne me obtundas, διο. “ Do not ever teaze me on this subject.”
Comp. Andr. ii. 2. 11 ; Ean. iii. 5. 6; Livy, ii. 15. ——35. Is meus est
