hoc mandatum’st tibi Ρ “ Have I explained this sufficiently to you ?”
“Do you understand me ?'’ Westerhove thinks this a kind of for-
mula„ —Ahl rogitare ,⁹ An ellipsis for an. opus est rogita-re? This
answer is to be supposed made with earnestness, and with an air of
countenance that speaks Parmeno to be under a good deal of concern.
It grieves him to see his master so anxious, and giving such particular
orders about a thing that was the easiest in the world to manage; for
this plainly intimated, that his'passion was come to such a height, as
must be very uneasy to himself, and would scarcely admit of a cure. —
