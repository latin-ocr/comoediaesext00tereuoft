the spectators says, Id populus curat, scilicet! Simo perceiving that
Davus made him no answer‚ speaks to him in an angry tona] Hoc age is
a formula commanding attention at the Roman sacrifices, but transferred ³
to other things. Comp. ii. 5. 43 Heaut. iii. 2. 47 ; Hor. Sat. ii. 3. 152.
The opposite to this formula is azias res agere, “to be inattentive.”

[Ironically.]—l7. Dum tempus ad eam rem. “While the proper
season for his youthful pranks continued.'’ Ad eam rem must be
construed with tempus. Comp. ii. 6. l2; Heaut. iv. 1. 54. —Animum
ut expleret sunm. “To take his fil] of pleasure.'' Explere animum is
elegantly said of those who give themselves up, without restraint, to
any affection of the mind, joy, love, or anger. Comp. iv. l. 17;
Adelph. i. 1. 8 ; Hec. v. l. 28 ; Ovid, Met. xii. 598. — 18. Aliam vitam.
“ A different mode of life.” —- 19. Postulo, sive aequnm’st, te oro. ‘⁸ I

length know‚’' Petron. c. 44. —— 21. Ita aiunt. A formula used when
the speaker is unwilling to assent to any general remark, made by the
person conversing with him. Comp. ii. 1. 21; Adelph. v. 8. 7. Ita

“ An evil counsellor.⁷' Comp. Phaedr. ii. 6. 163 Senec. Thyest. 310.
—- 22. Animum aegrotum, &c. “ He gives the unsettled mind a bias,
and makes bad worse.’' AEgrotum here signifies ‘⁶ disturbed by love.”
The ancient philosophers considered love, and the other affections of
the mind, as diseases. Cicero, Tusc. Qu. iii. 4, uses the words aegrotatio
mentis. — 23. Davus sum, uon OEdipus. “ Ι am a simple servants

“ Contriving any plots, to interrupt these nuptials.'¹ — 28. In pistrinum
ς· dedam. “ Ι will throw you into the work-house.” Pistrinum was a
