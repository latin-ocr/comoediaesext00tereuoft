348 EUNUCHUS.

1. 12. — 10. Disertum. Disertus here is not to be understood
“eloquent,’' in which sense it is frequently used by the poets,’‘ but
“one of quick discernment,'' who cannot be easily imposed upon or
deceived. ‘⁶ Shrewd.‘' An ingenious man can easily prevent, or
extricate himself from, any difficulties.

12. An poem'tebat flagiti, &c. “ Were you notcontented with the crime
you urged the youth to perpetrate, unless you afterwards betrayed him to
his father? '¹ An paenitebat here must not be rendered ‘⁴ did you repent,''
but “ were you not contented.’' So it is explained by Donatus, Wester-
hovius, Ruhnken, and others. Comp. Heaut. i. 1. 20, and Cic. Att.
i. 20, on which see Heusinger and Ernesti.— 13. Ni miserum. No·
for nisi. Comp. Livy, iii. 60. Miserum, “the unhappy Chaerea„”—-
Indicares ,⁹ For proderes. Comp. Heaut. iii. 3. 23. -- 14. Nam quid,
διο. Comp. iii. 5. 63. Animus is often put for the affections of the
mind. Comp. Adelph. iv. 5. 31. — Ubi vestem, διο. “ When his
father saw that he was clad with that garment.'’ Induere is construed
with two accusatives.-- “ There is a great error, in regard to the unity
of time, in Terence's Eunuch, when Laches, the old man, enters by
mistake into the house of Thais3 where betwixt his exit and the
entrance of Pythias, who comes to give ample relation of the disorders
he had raised within, Parmeno, who was left upon the stage, has not
above five lines to speak.'’ Thus Dryden, in his Essay on Dramatic
Poetry. Besides the absurdity here taken notice of by Dryden, in
regard to time, there is also another inconvenience in the present
instance arising from too strict an adherence to the unity of place.
What a figure would this narration of Pythias have made, if thrown
into action! The circumstances are in themselves as truly comio as
those of any scene in this excellent play3 and it would be well worth
while to follow Laches into the house, to be present at the ridiculous
distress and confusion which his presence must occasion. There is,
however, much more to be commended, and even imitated, than
censured, in the construction of this last act. All that passes between
Pythias, Parmeno, and Laches, is truly admirable.

16. An mentita es? ‘⁶ What! have you told me a falsehood?‘'
[Here Pythias laughs heartz‘ly.]— 17. Scelus. For scelesta. —Nimimm
“ Exceedingly delightfulx’ - 18. Siquidem istuc impune habueris.
[With bitterness :] “If you don’t pay dearly for this! ’'-— Reddam.
Supply vicem. Comp. Ovid, Am. i. 6. 23. —Creda “ Oh! I have
no doubt of it.’' Comp. ii. 2. 41.—-19. In diem. “Long distant*
Comp. Phorm. v. 2. 16. -—— 20. Tu jam pendebis. “ You will be tied up
this very day.'’ Slaves were punished by being tied up to a post, and
lashed with rods, or thongs of leather. Comp. Phorm. i. 4. 42.—
Nobilz'tas. “Renderest notorious.’'-—2l. Indicas. See vs. 13³2-
Exempla. Comp. v. 4⁴. 23.—22. Nullus sum. ·“I am undone.'’ -2
Hic pro illo munere, &c. “ This is the reward paid you for that office.''
Honos is sometimes put for praemz'um, and munus for officium. Comp.
Cic. ad Div. xvi. 9; Caes. B. C. ii. 21; Livy, ii. 12; Sueten. Aug.
e. 45. —Abeo. [Exit Pythiae] —- 23. Egomet meo, 8ῑο- “ Ι have, like
a rat, betrayed myself to-day by my own squeaking.'' This was a

proverbial saying, directed against those who by their own conduct
procured their own ruin.
