ACT V. Scmm VII.

Thaso, impatient to be again reconciled to Thais, appears here with
a resolution of professing an entire submission, referring, in the usual
{ay of his vanity, to the example of Hercules, whom he proposes as

is pattern.

Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic.

l. Quid nunc Ρ [Enter Thraso and Gnatho ,· Parmeno behind] The
reader ought to remember, that this is the very person who before,
speaking to the captain concerning Thais, had said (iii. 1. 58.)‚ Jam
dudum te amat ,- and again (iv. 7. 41), Jam hoec tibi aderit supplicans
ultro. And here we may see the usual end of fiattery; for the same
person who before had given him hopes, endeavours now to throw him
into despair. It is worthy of notice too, that Gnatho is always drawn
away from the table with reluctance; for before, in the quarrel, it is
evident from Tilraso’s words, that Gnatho followed against his will.

With the entrance of Laches into the house of Thais, and, in con-
sequence of it, his consent to the marriage of Chaerea with Pamphila,
the fable of the Eunuch is certainly concluded: and all that follows,
like the last scene of the Andria, is but the lame completion of an
episode, limping after the main action. In the first four acts the
adventures of Thraso are so artfully interwoven with the other business
of the play, that they are fairly blended and incorporated with the
fable of the Eunuch: but here we perceive, that though our author
has got rid of one of Menander’s pieces, the other, the Colax, still
hangs heavy on his hands. Were an author to form his play on
twenty different pieces, if he could melt them all down into one action,
there would be no impropriety3 but if he borrows only from two,
whenever the episode ceases to act as one of the necessary springs of
the main action, it becomes redundant; and the unity of the action
(perhaps the only unity which ought never to be violated) is destroyed.
Thraso, says Donatus, is brought back again, in order to be admitted
to some share in the good graces of Thais, that he may not be made
unhappy at the end of the play. But surely it is an essential part of
the poetica] justice of comedy, to expose coxcombs to ridicule, and to
punish them, though without any shocking severity, for their follies.
