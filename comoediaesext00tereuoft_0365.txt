Aer 111. scENE v. 327

ibo in gratiam ejus. For Terence osten puts ab eo instead of ejus, as in
the Andria, i. l. 129. — 10. Chaerea, quid est. [Antipho goes apto him.]
- Quod. For propter quod. — Quid sibi hic vestitus quoerit? “ What
means this dress '2’' Quid sibi vult Ρ is the more usual expression. -
12. Taces quid ? Σιγᾷς τί. ·-- Ο festas dies hominis .' ‘⁴ O happy lot of
man!'’ That is, Ο how happy the lot of man may sometimes be!
From this reading, says Ruhnken, no satisfactory sense can be drawn.
Bentley conjectured, O festus dies l O meus amicus! salve. Oudendorp,
and Gesner (Leoe. Tot. Lat.) adopt this reading, supplying dies to
amicus. See Gronov. Diatr. e. 43. Meus festus dies, in Plaut. Cas. i.
1. 49, is addressed to a person in the sense of “ my joy !” Schmieder
the younger thinks Ο festus dies hominis is used here in the same way,
and addressed to Antipho. Colman renders it, “ O happy, happy day ν’
The expression, Ο festus dies hominis! says Patrick, is here somewhat
remarkable. Festus dies hominis for homo qui es quasi festus dies. The
manner of speaking, though somewhat singular, is yet very frequent in
ancient authors. Thus scelus homo, pietas animi, sententia dia Catonis .-
and Plautus, just as here, sine amabo, amari te meus festus dies.
Madame Dacier’s translation is bon jour, which really is ridiculous. —
15. Nempe, opinor, Thaidem. “ You mean, I suppose, Thais.'' So
nempe de tuo, “you mean of your own,'’ Plaut. Trin. ii. 2. 47.

16. Sic commemineram. “ So I fancied.” — 18. Elegans formarum
spectator. This Lucian expresses by the single word φιλόκαλος, “a
nice judge of beauty,” “ a person of fine taste.'' Patrick observes
that these three are, perhaps, the most proper terms that could have
been pitched upon by any writer, to express Chaerea’s delicacy in this
point. Forma answers exactly to our word “abeauty.'' Spectare is
‘⁴ to view,” “ examine‚” or ‘⁴ judge of with attention.'’ Elegantes are
those who know how to make a right choice. — 19. In hac commotus
sum. Ruhnken observes upon this, that the Latin poets, in speaking
of love, use the ablative in preference to the accusative. Thus in Ovid,
Met. vii. 21, quid in hospite, regia virgo, Ureris? Comp. Ovid‚'Art.
Am. i. 731. See Heinsius on Virg. AEn. vii. 6213 and Broukhus. on
Propert. iii. 6. 28. ——Primam “The first of womankind.’' Primam
is put here for proecipuam or pulcherrimam. Primus not only relates to
numerica] order, but also to praise. Comp. i. 1. 5; Heaut. v. 2. 10;
Petron. c. 40. — 20. Quid multa verba ‚⁹ Supply dicam. Comp. Andr.
i. 1. 723 Eun. iii. 2. 43-—Amare coepi. ‘⁶ Ι fell in love with her.” —-
22. Submcmuit. “ Gave me a gentle hint.’' Submonuit is a very
proper word here, on account of arripui in the next verse. Donatus
observes, the whole is well conceived3 because, as it was not fit for an
ingenuous youth to be ready at contriving projects of this kind, so,
when hinted by another, it was plainly the part of a lover to embrace it
eagerly. -- 23. Ibi. “ Thereupon.'’ —— Quod ego arripui. “Which I
seized eagerly.’' — Tacitus citius audies. “ If you keep silent you will
hear it sooner.''

26. Viderem. Supply ut. ——— Essem una. This may be taken in the
same sense as cibum nonnunquam capiet cum ea, ii. 3. 77. But see Cic.
pro Coel. c. 193 Ovid, Art. Am. iii. 6643 Broukhus. on Tibull. iv. 7. 10.
— Quicum. Comp. Adelph. iV. 7. 32 3 Phorm. v. 1. 32. -— 31. In
interiore parte. “ In an inner apartment.'’ In Greece the women
always occupied the interior apartments, where nobody was permitted
to come to them, but relations and the slaves that waited upon them.
