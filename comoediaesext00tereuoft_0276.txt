,—108. Cerneres. ‘⁴ You might judge,” or “ one might judge.” The ,
‘1 second person of the imperfect subjunctive is often thus elegantly put ,
³ for the third. Comp. vs. 39; Petron. c. viii. and xix3 Livy. iii. 11.-. j
109. Rejecit se in eum. “ Threw herself back into his arms very farni- ⁵
liarly and wept.'’ Familiariter here refers to the verb rejecit. Valla
incorrectly refers it to flens, doubtless on account of vs. 84. Quam for
valde is osten joined with adjectives in the positive degree. Comp. -

It may not be improper here to produce Cicero’s testimony in favour J
of this narration :—-“ If brevity consists in using no more words than ,
are absolutely necessary, such a style may sometimes be expedient: l
but it is often extremely prejudicial to a narrative3 not only as it ren· 4¹
ders it obscure, but as it takes off that air of ease and cheerfulness, and
force of persuasion, which are the chief properties of a narrative. In 3·

Terence, for instance, how minute and particular is that narration 1
which commences with-.- ἒ

Nam is postquam excessit ex ephebis, Sosia. ’ἑ
The manners of the youth himself, the curiosity of the slave, the Ξ
death of Chrysis, the look, and figure, and grief of the sister, are drawn a
at full length, and in the most agreeable colours. But if he had, ἶ

through the whole, affected a brevity like that of the following passage, ἒ

Funus interim
Procedit: sequimur .· ad sepulcrum venimus:
I n iynem imposita est: fletur ;

the whole might have been comprised in little more than ten short s
verses: and yet, in these very expressions, funus procedit: sequimur, 4-
concise as they are, the poet was rather studious of beauty than
brevity. For had there been nothing more than in ignem imposita est,-
the whole might have clearly been understood. But it enlivens a
narration to mark it with characters, and intersperse it with spffiches ς ἶ
and the fact itself receives a greater air of probability, when you relate
the manner in which it passed.”—De Oratore, ii. 80. ,
110. Quid ais ‚⁹ A formula used in astonishment. Comp. iii. 3. 43. χ

gundum causae put for objurgandi causa. Comp. Livy, viii. 13. — 112.
Quid feei ‚⁹ quid commerui? Αὔξησις. “ What crime have I com-
mitted? what deserved 2⁹⁵ See Servius on Virg. AEn. iv. 335. — 114.
Honesta oratio est. “ A fair excuse.'' —Reete putas. Nothing can
mark the fiat simplicity of Sosia’s character stronger than the insipidity
of this speech. — 115. Tulit. For attulit. — 116. Quid facias ilbi. Τί
ἅνλποιήσοις ἐκείνῳ ὃς ἄρα δεδωκώς ἤ ζημίαν ἤ κακόν. -— Dederit damnum.
This is correctly said for damnum intulerit. So malum dare for malo
officere, ii. 5. 20. The words damnum facere would not convey this '
sense, for they signify “ to suffer an injury.’' — 118. Indignum facinus. .
“ Saying that my son’s conduct was most disgraceful.” Some consider
this as uttered in indignatIOn by Simo, “ O, disgraceful conduct w ’
Others join indignum facinus with comperisse, “that he had detected a
most shameful business, most disgraceful conduct.” Facinus from facto
signifies any deed, good or bad, but it is generally taken in the lette}
sense. Comp. Eun. i. 1. 25; Phorm. iv. 3. 8.-119. Hanc peregrinam-
