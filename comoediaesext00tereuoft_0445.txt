takes a middle way between the too great severity of Demea, and the
overstrained indulgence of Micio. (See the Adespki.) He endeavours
to make his son sensible of his error, by showing the present infamy
that attended a course of debauchery, and the future ruin wherewith it
threatened him. These remonstranees we find have the wished-for
effect3 the young man is ashamed of his folly, and resolves to change
for the better. — 9. Omisso. “ Negligent.” Comp. Adelph. v. 3.45. —

is here observed3 nor was this without design in the poet. For Chremes
would appear to his son to act with the strictest regard to justice.
When he found that prudence required he should not leave his fortune
at the disposal of his son, who had, indeed, the first and best right to
it, he went to the next in blood, his sister. Yet they were bestowed
with such restrictions as to make it in a manner only a trust. — Com-

counsel, and most happily applied3 in opposition to the rash and extra-
vagant wish of a young man, who, not knowing the value of life, nor
the real good purposes it may be made to serve, can heedlessly throw
away life, on account of some check in his little and vain pursuits.

succenseo. However provoked Chremes might be against Syrus, he
here dissembles it, because he would seem to act, at present, not
through anger or passion, but from prudenee. He wants, if possible,
to reform his son by the soster methods of persuasion ; and he remem-
bers, that he himself had spirited up Syrus to the fallacy; which to
discover, and that his own counsel had been turned against him, must
make him appear ridieulous. He therefore wisely defers giving way
to his resentment against Syrus, till a fitter opportunity should offer.
