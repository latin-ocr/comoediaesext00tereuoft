long before demonstrated the horror, not only of these murders, but
even of exposing children. But philosophy is always weak when
opposed to customs authorised by long usage. -—- 23. Non simulare, &c.
Simulare mortem verbis refers to the method Sostrata had taken of exe—
cuting her husband’s orders ; not having2barbarity enough to murder
her child with her own hands, she gave it to be exposed, for that
was properly no more than affecting in words to put it to death. Re
ipsa spem vitae dare is to leave it the means of preservation by causing
it to be only exposed. For infants, when exposed, were, for the most
part, by some chance or other, preserved, as we leam from many
instances.- 24. Misericordia, διο. Supply te impulerunt ut exponeres.
—25. Pro-spectum. The same as provisum. Comp. Cic. ad Div. iii.
2. -- Quid voluisti? “ What could you mean?’' Comp. Phaedr. ii. 8.
5.- 26. Illi anai prodita. ‘⁴ Betrayed to that old beldam.’' — 27. Uti
veniret palam. ‘⁴ To be sold publicly as a slave.'' —28. Credo, διο.
“So she but lived, it was enough, you thought.”—29. Quid cum
illisce agas, &c. “ What can one do, or how proceed‚ with those who
know of neither reason, right, nor justice? '¹ It is raising difficulties to
no purpose, to refer this to merchants who deal in slaves, or those
women who make it their business to betray the young and beautiful
of their own sex. It regards only Sostrata, and the imprudence
wherewith Chremes charges her. Illis, the plural for the singular.
Comp. i. 1. 99 ; Andr. v. 3. 20. Agas, the second person for the third.

indulgent too.” For quando many editions have quanto. Bentley, 2
without any authority whatever, inserted in the text, Quanto tu me es

annis gravior, tanto es ignoscentior. —Ignoscentior. “ More ready to
pardon.'' Ovid (Trist. iii. 5, 31) seems to have imitated Terence.—
33. Jnstitia tua. ‘⁴ Thy lenity.’' Comp. Andr. i. 1. 9 ; Cic. pro Marcell.
c. 4. Perlet thinks this is spoken ironically. — 34. Factum ignoscam.
This verb is eonstrued with an accusative also in Virg. Cal. vs. 2933
Plaut. Amph. i. 1. 100. —35. Male docet te, διο. “ Forgiving you thus
easily, 1 do but teach you to offend again.” —- 37. Religiosoe. “ Super-
stitious.'' - Do, detraho, dico. For dabam, detrahebam, dicebam.
Comp. iii. 1. 833 Eun. iv. 7. 22. —39. Ne expers, διο. The ancients
imagined they were guilty of a most heinous crime if they suffered
their children to die without having possessed some part of their
fortune. The women, therefore, who are generally superstitious, when
they exposed their children, put some Jewel, or other trinket, among
their clothes, by this means thinking to discharge their claim of inhe-
ritance, and to clear their own conscience.

40. Istuc recte. [Ironically.] Chremes answers, that by bestowing
that jewel upon her daughter, she had done two things instead of one ε
ehe had complied with her own superstitious notions, and preserved her
daughter’s life. For scarcely any one would have taken the trouble to
bring up the child, but for this jewel, from which they who found her
might naturally conclude, that she might one day be acknowledged
and redeemed by her parents. — Conservasti te. “ You have satisfied
your own mind‚’' in yielding to the dictates of your superstition.
