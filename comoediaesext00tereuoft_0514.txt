thunder storm was called by the augurs vitium, when, in consequence
of it, the comitia were deferred; if it thundered and hailed at the same
time, they called it vitium et calamitas. Hence vitium came to signify
“ an impediment.” Comp. Eun. i. l. 34. Hence also the phrase
vitio creati magistratus, signifying that some ill omen occurred at the
time of their election, which rendered their nomination informal.
Comp. Cic. Phil. ii. 32. -— 3. Ut neque spectari. “ So that it could
neither be seen, nor any judgment formed of it.’' See Perizon. on Sanct-
Min. iv. 11. Comp. Andr. Prol. 24, 27. - 4. Ita populus studio
stupidus, διο. “The people‚ held by amazement, had so fixed their
attention on a rope-dancer.’' Here we discover the poet's anxiety to
preserve his reputation. He tells us, the ill reception his play met
with, at its first representation, was not owing to any defect or want ol
merit in the piece itself, but because the attention of the audience was
otherwise employed. The word stupidus does not signify the same
here as “stupid,’' in our language‚ but denotes an earnest attention
mixed with astonishment and wonder—a keenness proceeding from
admiration and surprise. —5. Animum occuparat. The same as animum
occupatum habebat.—Nune kaec plane est pro nova. “Now this is
clearly brought on as a new comedy.’' ⁷ “

7. Iterum referre. “ Bring it on the stage again,” the same day¹
aster the rope-dancing exhibition had ceased.—It appears from this
that Terence was very confident of the merit of his play3 and it ἱε
worthy our notice too, that he would rather be esteemed anticione,
than diffident of himself. This was a strong recommendation of the
comedy, because the aediles would never have made another purchase
of it, unless they had conceived highly of its merit— 8. Alias.
Terence wrote several plays before the Andria, though that is the
only one left of those exhibited by him before the Hecyra. The
Adeqmi was the last piece he wrote.

This Prologue is composed with wonderful art, and an uncommor
power of persuasion 3 for as it had been valready twice at least rejected
there was need of great address to bring it again upon the stage
