pecuniae. Comp. Ovid, Art. Am. ii. 279. — Qui dissolverem. For unde
solverem, “whereby to pay my debts.'' Dissolvo is used in the same
manner by Cicero, Sull. c. 20. —51. Etiam nunc. “ Even now ;'’ i. e.

l. 6. - 56. Quid, si animam debet? This is taken from the Greek
proverb: Αὐτὴν τὴν ψυχὴν ὀφείλει, which is said of a person who is so
overwhelmed with debt, that it is wholly out of his power to extricate
himself. ——Ager oppositus ’st pignori. “A small farm is mortgaged for
ten minae.'' —— 57. Ob decem mnas. Μνᾶς. Thus it frequently occurs in
Plautus. *Aga age, jam ducat. ‘⁴ Well, well, let him take her: I will
pay the money.”—-58. AEdiculae item. “ He has also a small house
mortgaged.’' - 59. Petito ἱῐίαεσε, &c. “ Demand those ten minae

Madame Dacier observes. that this explication, though it is the more
general and common, and gives more lise and spirit to the sentence, is
yet liable to exception, because it was not Phormio's part to begin an
action against Demipho, who on the contrary was most likely to attack
him. She therefore offers another interpretation: “ Let him raise six
hundred articles if he will, I will give nothing: ” observingthat dica is
frequently used to signify “ an article of account.'’ The objection she
mentions has no foundation. Demipho is here concerting whether he
can rid himself of Phanium upon easy terms, by making some con-
cessions to Phormio3 or if he must bundle her out of doors, and run
the hazard qf a law suit, for having done so. When, therefore, he finds
the demands of Phormio so unreasonable‚ he resolves upon the latter
course, and to run the hazard of whatever actions the parasite might
bring against him. — Sexcentas. Donatus remarks on this passage,
that “ six hundred'’ was used by the Romans for an indefinite number,
as “ ten thousand” was among the Greeks; and that Terence, accord-
ing to the genius of the Latin language, translated μυρίας, the word
used by Apollodorus, by sexcentas. Comp. Cic. Verr. i. 47. — Scribito
dicas. Comp. i. 2. 7 75 ii. 2. 15.—-64. Impuratus me ille, δίο. “ What!
afford the villain besides an opportunity to laugh at me ?” Comp.
