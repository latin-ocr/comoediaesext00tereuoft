ACT II. Semta Ι.

Laches accuses his wife Sostrata, that, by her severity and disagree-
able temper, she had driven her daughter-in-law from the house.
Sostrata, on the contrary, maintains, that this charge is without
foundation.

Of this scene, verses 1, 20—45, are Tetrameter Trochaics Catalecti03
vs. 9, a Dimeter Iambic Acatalectic; vs. 19, a Trimeter Iambic. The
remainder consists of Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic.

1. Pro Deum, δῖε. Donatus remarks, that this scene opens the
intention of Terence to oppose the generally received opinion, and to
draw the character of a good mother-in-law. It would, therefore, have
been a very proper scene to begin the play, as it carries us immediately
into the midst os things; and we cannot fail to be inter-ested, where we
see the persons acting, so deeply interested themselves. We gather
from it just so much of the story, as is necessary for our information
at first setting out. We are told of the abrupt departure of Philumena,
and are witnesses of the confusion in the two families of Laches and
Phidippus. The absence of Laches, which had been in a great measure
the occasion of this misunderstanding, is also very artfully mentioned
in the altercations between him and Sostrata. The character of Laches
is very naturally drawn. He has a good heart, and a testy dispositiom
and the poor old gentleman is kept in such constant perplexity, that
he has perpetual occasion to exert both these qualities. — Pro Deum
