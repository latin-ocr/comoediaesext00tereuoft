ACT IV. Scssm: II.

In this scene Pamphilus is introduced in conversation with his
mother. She had been told by Laches of the declarations he had made
in her favour, and, resolved not t'o yield to him in point of generosity,
proposes to retire into the country, and leave him at liberty to take
home his wife. This offer, which she thought would be well received,
is altogether inconsistent with his views, as it deprives him of a
pretence for separating from Philumena; and, therefore, he eamestly
urges her not to think of it.

The meter is T etrameter Iambic Acatalectic.

deal of tenderness and affectionate regard in this form of swearing.
Some commentators, however, seem not to have thoroughly under·-
stood the force of it. The real meaning is. “So may you in every
thing answer my hopes· . '' i. e. So may I receive from you all that joy
and consolation, which a mother hopes for and desires from a son.— ΜΞ
Di ἄ. in this verse is a dactyl.—4. Ut nunquam sciens commerui. “As I
never willingly committed any wrong towards her.’' Comp.iii.5. 36.
A similar mode of affirmation occurs in Cic. Att. v. 15 : Ita vivam, ut
maximos sumtus facio. -Merz‘to ut caperet, διο. Constr. Ut odium mei
merito caperet illam .- “ That she should conceive hatred against me.''

believed that you loved me, you have this day confirmed my belief in
that idea.'' — 6. Tuus pater narravit. Comp. iii. 5. 32. -— Me habueris
