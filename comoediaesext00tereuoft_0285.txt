8. “ While the mind wavers in uncertainty, the smallest trifie turns it
either way.’' Madame Dacier, Westerhovius‚ Ruhnken, and others,
consider this a metaphor from a pair of scales in equilibrium. That
which turns a scale is properly called momentum, from moveo. Donatus
refers it to a huge weighty mass, which, while it is still in its erect posi-
tion, and hanging in suspense, is overturned by the slightest touch. In
the beautiful story of Myrrha, Ovid, Met. x. 378, there is a passage
which the commentators suppose to be in imitation of this :

thue securi
Saucia trabs ingens, ubiplaqa novissima restat,⁴
Quo cadat, in dubio est, omnique a parte timetur:
Sic animus varin labefactus vulnere nutat
Huc levis atque illuc, momentaque sumit utroque.

32. Quid agit? “ How is Glycerium ‘2⁹’ Comp. Hec. iii. 2. 10. —-
33. Laborat e dolore. The preposition is usually omitted. Though the
word laborat, says Colman, has tempted Donatus and the rest of the
commentators to suppose that this sentence signified Glycerium’s
being in labour, I cannot help concurring with Cooke, that it means
simply that ‘⁴ she is weighed down with grief.” The words imme-
diately subsequent corroborate this interpretation τ and at the conclusion
of the scene, when Mysis tells him she is going for a midwife, Pamphi-
lus hurries her away as he would naturally have done, had he understood
by these words that her mistress “ was in labour.” — 35. Conari queam ?
Supply facere. Comp. Phorm. i. 2. 2. — 36. Propter me. Ruhnken
says this is put for opera mea, “ by my means.’' Others take it more
literally, “ for my sake.’' Comp. Eun. v. 5. 29 ; Hec. v. 3. 35. --— 38.
Egregie. See note on i. 1. 31. -- 39. Bene et pudice, διο. Ordo ι
Sinam ejus ingenium doctum atque eductum bene et pudice, &c. Eductam
