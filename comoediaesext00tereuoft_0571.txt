here repeats what had been agreed upon among them, at the first
concerting of this enterprise. As they foresaw that Antipho's father
would be offended, they had taken care to provide an excuse, viz. that
the virgin’s cause was made clear and evident, so as to leave no room
for opposition. The same plea, Geta sayS‚ is now to be made, as being
the most specious one they could think of in the present exigence. —

particularly with respect to some weighty and important matter.

Comp. Virg. AEn. v. 378. -- Ego in subsidiis. “ I will station myself
here «in the rear, to sustain you, if you in any point give ground.'’ A
continuation of the figure. Subsidia were bodies of troops placed in
the rear of an army, to support it, if in any place it lost ground ς and
to renew the battle. Sue-centuriati were sold-iers who filled up the
vacancies in the companies, when they wore impaired by battle.
Deficere is also a military word. See Caes. B. G. iii. 64.

 

ACT ΙΙ. SCENE I.

In this scene we have Demipho expressing his displeasure at his
son’s behaviour: and Phaedria and Geta defend him to the utmost of
their power. Geta wisely conceals himself for some time, and keeps
watch, in order to overhear what reception Phaedria meets with, resolv-
ing to take his measures accordingly. Finding things go on smoothly,
and that Phaedria acted his part to admiration, he ventures to ad-
vanoe. By their joint pleading‚ Demipho is a little pacified; and
considering Phormio as the author of al] the mischief, he desires to
meet, and expostulate with him.

Of this scene, verses 1, 2, 22, 23, are Tetrameter Trochaics Cata-
lectic; verses 3—21‚ Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic. The remainder
of the scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.
