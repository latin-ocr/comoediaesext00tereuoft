“ Well! what then ?'' [answers Chaerea] —49. Advocatus. This word

πόθου χρόνος τοῖς ποθοῦσι &cnei—Num quid velit. “ If he had any

“There is an end of it! Have done! Allis now over.’' For ilicetsee note i.
1. 9.- conclamatum est is a metaphor from funeral ceremonies. It was
customary, when any person died, for the family to set up a cry, either ¹
to bring their neighbours together, or to awaken the soul, if still linger-
ing about the body. See Servius on Virg. AEn. vi. 218. -57. Alias
