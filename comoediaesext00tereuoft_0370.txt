ACT IV. SCENE IV.

Phaedria, having gone home to look for the Eunuch, finds him; and
as he had no suspicion of the project that had been formed between
Chaerea and Parmeno, drags him out, fully assured that he is the
same Pythias meant, and preparing for further ssight by the change of
his dress. But when Pythias saw him, and knew nothing of him, he
is perfectly astonished. Upon questioning a little, he comes to know
all the truth‚ and is strangely disconcerted; but willing, if possible,
to bring himself off, he makes Dorus deny every thing he had said.

Of this scene the first thirty-four verses are Trimeter Iambics3 the
remainder‚ Tetrameter T rochaics Catalectic.

l. Exisoras. [Re-enter Phaedrta, with Dorus the Eunuch in Ckaeraa's
ctothes.]— At etiam restitas ? “ What, are you resty too ?‘’ At etiam
are particles used in anger. Comp. Andr. iv. 4. 23. -2. Prodi, male
conciliate. [Phaedria drags him into the street.] “ Come forth, thou vile
bargain !'' Conciliare is often used for emere. Comp. Plaut. Epid. iii.
4. 36; Pseud. i. 2. 1. - Obsecro. ‘⁶ I beseech you.’' [crying.] — 3.
Illud vide, os ut, διο. “ See the vile wretch! what a wry fmouth it
makes.'' -- 4. Quid huc reditio 'st ? ‘⁶ What means this coming back ‘2⁹’
The verba] reditio with the verb est, is put for rediisti ,- so mutatio est for
mutasti. Comp. Andr. ii. 3. 263 Adelph. iii. 3. 67 ς Phorm. ii. l. 63.
In the latter clause Terence might have written vestem, because these
verbals govern the case of the verbs, from which they are formed. See
Voss. de Anal. iii. 9. -— 5. Paulum si cessassem. [Turning to Pythias]
“ If Ι had delayed a minute longer, Pythias, I had missed him.'’
Donatus observes, that it is usual with angry persons to turn away
from the object of their wrath, and address a third party. Comp.
Andr. v. 3. 5 ς Phorm. v. 8. 22. -6. Ita jam adornaratsugam. ‘¹ He
had already so well equipped himself for fiight.'' Adornarefitgam means
“to prepare for flight.” Comp. Plaut. Epid. v. 1. 9. -- 7. Haben’
hominem Ρ “ Have you caught the rogue ?''- 11. Nostrarum. This,
says Donatus, is either an archaism for the genitive plural nostrum, or it
agrees with famularum understood. Quisquam is an archaism for quaequam.
