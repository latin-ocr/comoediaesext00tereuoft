Tragedies and comedies are properly divided into five parts, calleff ζ
Acts, from the various actions they contain. Neve minor, neu sit quanto 'J
productior actu Fabula, Hor. Epist. ad Pis. 189. The minor divisione* ¹
are called Scenes, from scena, “the stage,” or “front of the theatro ..
where the actors performed? Every change' 1n the representation eon-

” stitutes a scene. Scena' is derived from σκηνὴ,66 a tent,” because playn ς
Ι were originally performed m the fields and under the'shade. Γ

The scene opens with Simo returning from the forum, followed by‘, ῖῖ,
servants with provisions. We are informed by Madam D’acier, that iu ὲ. ,ὲ
an ancient MS. of Terence, having figures prefixed to each scene, two? ⁷ ²
slaves were here represented entering Simo’ s house, one of whom cnr-¹ „
