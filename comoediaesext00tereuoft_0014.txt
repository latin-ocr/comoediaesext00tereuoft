PREFACE.

The T ext is, copied, with very few alterations, from the
accurate edition of Reinhardt, prepared under the super-
intendence of Professor Bekker of Berlin, and first printed
at Leipsic in 1827.

Prefixed to this edition is a short account of the Metres
of Terence,'with scales of the different sorts of verses
adopted in these plays, which, it is hoped, will be found
accurate and satisfactory. And at the head of the Notes
on every scene has been inserted a key to the scanning,
by means of which, and of the Meti-ical Scales, every line
in the six comedies may be easily measured.

To T. A. Beck, Esq. of Esthwaite Lodge, near Hawks-
head, who also furnished the third ExcursuS, the compiler
is indebted sor the Biographical Sketch of our poet. The
brief Chronology appended thereto, has been compiled
with great accuracy from various sourceS‚ and will, per-
haps, throw some light on the life of Terence.

In consequence of Dr. Hickie’s absence from London,
the labours of the press have been superintended by the
editor of Anthon’s Horace, Sallust, and Cicer03 the correct-
ness of which has been generally acknowledged. He has
spared no pains to give the same character to the present
publication ; and in consequence of occasional alterations
in the lining of the text, the numerous references have
been diligently examined, and the whole adapted to the
latest and most approved editions of the authors quoted.

London, March laet, 1837.
