ACT V. Sann V.

Laches is introduced here returning from his country seat, making
some reflections on the conveniency of its situation,—just in the
neighbourhood of the town. Seeing Parmeno, he goes up to him,
who, full of fears for Chaerea, cannot hide his concern, but discovers
it to the old man by his trembling and confusion. At last, with much
ado, he tells him all. Laches, astonished at so many misfortunes
threatening him at once, and angry with Parmeno, whom he looks
upon as partly a promoter of his son’s irregularities, breaks away in
haste to prevent the mischief that he imagines to threaten his son.

The metre is Trimeter Iambic.

1. Ex meo, &a [Enter Laches, speaking to himseffl]‚ We have here,
observes Madame Dae-ier, the old man approaching peaceably, his head
not filled with any cares, one that does not suspect any mischief, who
thinks only of the convenience of his country seat. All this is very

, happily conceived by the poet, that the good man may be the more
deeply affected by the news, which he is just going to hear from
Parmeno. For by this the sudden change of his condition is better
perceived, and affects the audience more strongly. -2. Odium. For
fastidium, or taedium. Comp. iii. 1. 14; Lacr. iii. 80. Perciperepro—
perly signifies ‘⁴ to take total possession.'' Here it may be explained
by the simple capia—3. Satias. Comp. Hec. iv. 2. 18.-6. Quis
homo ’st ? Parmeno had seen the old man before, (v. 4. 45,) and taken
the resolution os discovering all to him. This question, therefore,
cannot be meant sor information‚ but is merely a finesse, to prevent
the old man from suspecting he had any artifice against hinu- for a
meeting so seemingly accidental gives every thing, he says, an air of
being natural, and without design. —Salvom te, Sco. Comp. Heaut. ii.
