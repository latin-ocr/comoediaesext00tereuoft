ACT IV. SCENE VII.

Chremes returns with the money, which he gives to Clitipho, to
carry to Bacchis; who, notwithstanding the lessons of Syrus, could
not stifle his astonishment at a thing so unexpected, and to him unac-
countable. Syrus is, therefore, obliged to quicken, and in a manner
force him along with him: when the old man, left alone upon the
stage, falls into a train of profound reflections-upon human life, and
the power of custom. ’

The metre is the same as in the former scene.

many things, whether just or unjust, are established by custom!”
Comp. Adelph. v. 9. 33. This genuine reading has been preserved by
Eugraphius, approved of by Fabricius and Guyetus‚ and restored by
Bentley. The common reading was, Quam multa injusta ac prava·
fiunt moribus ‚¹ Madame Dacier proposed, Quam multa injusta, justa
fiant moribus! “ How many things, in themselves unjust, derive an
appearance of justice from custom! ” with this note: I am chat-med
with this sentiment, and still more with the good man's application of¹
it. For, in fact, nothing can be more ridiculous, than thatwhen a father>
bestows his daughter upon a man, he must also bestow part of his'
fortune with her. And, as a proof that custom only authorizes such a*
