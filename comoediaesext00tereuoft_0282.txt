244 ANDRIA.

mala, vs. 10. — 7. Ne quam faciam, διο. “ Lest I devise some trick to
break off the match.’' This refers to i. 2. 25. —8. Causam ceperit.
“He may seize on any pretence.” Causa very frequently signifies
“ a pretence‚'’ or ‘⁶ pretext.” Comp. Eun. v. 5. 30 ; ovid Trist. ii. 451 ς
Livy, ii. 32.—9. Quo jure. This is the reading of all MSS. and
ancient editions. Bentley observes, that quo jure, quaque injuria, can
by no means subsist in this place ; for that though the sentence seems
complete, yet there is a word wanting: besides qua is necessarily
required here, not quo. He therefore reads qua jure, qua me injuria.
In this manner of arranging a sentence, the Latins never said qua,
quaque, but qua, qua. Comp. Livy, x. 38 ; Plin. Epist. ix. 2; Heinsius
on Val. Flac. v. 85 3 and Gronov, Obss. iii. 12. Quajure, qua injuria,
“ any way, right or wrong.'’ It is a proverbial expression equivalent
to the Greek δικαίως καὶ ἀδίκως. - Praecz‘pz’tem in pistrinum. “ Head-
long into the workhouse.’' Comp. i. 2. 28. Praeeipitem dare signifies
ἓ to throw with violence.’' Comp. Plzorm. iv. 3. 303 Sall. Cat. c. 31 3
atull. cv. 2.

10. Ad haec mala. “Another missortune too, to make bad worse.”
— 12. Audire est operoe pretium. “ It is worth¹ one’s while to hear the
height of their assurance.'' Comp. Livy, i. 54. In this phrase, pre-
tium is sometimes omitted, as in Tacit. Arm. i. 57.-— 13. Inceptio. This
is properly said of “a rash undertaking.’' See Cort. on Sall. Cat. c. 20.
ξ —Amentium haud amantium. ljaronomasia. This figure is generally
“ used in anger or derision; sometTr'fi‘e‘s‘even'in serious discourse.- 14.
Quicquid. So the ancients usually spoke of a child before it was born.
We find quod used in the same manner, iii. l. 6. Comp. Plaut. Amph.
i. 3. 3.— Tollere. “To bring up and educate.'' Tollere properly
denotes “to take up,'’ and alludes to a custom among the ancient

Greeks. As soon as a child was born, it was laid on the ground, and-
the person so doing invoked the assistance of Rhea in its behalf. If

the father was willing to educate it, he, or some one in his absence, took
it up and placed it in his bosom. If no notice was taken ofthe child,
it was doomed to be exposed. — 15. Fingunt quandam fallat-iaia. ‘⁵ They
devise some false story.” Comp. Eun. i. 2. 58.-—16. Civem Atticam.
f If Glycerium could be proved to be an Athenian citizen, the laws of the
ζ Athenians would compel Pamphilus to marry her. Fuit olim. Supply
inquiunt. — 17. Navem is fregit. “ He was shipwrecked upon the island
of A.ndros.”—— 18. Obiit mortem. “ Died.” The substantive mortem in
this phrase is very osten omitted.
Ι Hanc ejectam orbam. “This orphan wreck.” Ejectus is properly
³ said of a ship or a person cast ashore. Comp. v. 4. 20 3 Virg. AEn. iv.
374. Hence it is figuratively applied to a person become “ destitute ”
of means, in Cic. pro Quint. c. 19.- 19. Fabulae! “All mere fables:
ridiculousw—20. At. For et tamen: “And yet the story pleases
them.” See Cort. on Sall. Jug. c. 4; and Graev. on Cic. Att. vi. 1.-
21. Ab ea. “ From the house of Glycerium.” Comp. Heaut. ii. 2. 6;
Plzorm. v. 1. 5.--Ηίηο me ad forum. Supply conferam. In phrases of
this kind the verb signifying motion to a place is osten omitted. See
ν. Gronov. on Senec. Tr. 844; and Duker on Flor. iii. 6. Davus expects
ξ to find Pamphilus in the forum. It was there the idle Athenians were
accustomed to meet, converse, and lounge away their time 3 for it served
the purpose of a public walk. There the market was held, and the
courts of justice situated. -- 22. · Imprudentem. “ Unawares.³’ A
