TIBIIS PAmssth nnxrms m· smxsrms. “ Composed for equal
fiutes, right-handed and left-handed,'' i. e. for Lydian flutes to be ,
used during one partos the performance, and for Tyrian, or Sarrane ἓ
flutes, to be used during another part. The tibiae, or flutes of the ἦ
ancients‚ were of two sorts, tibiae deaetrae and tibiae sinistroe. According .‘
to Pliny, N. H. xvi. 36, they were made of reed; the former, of the ἢ
middle of the reed; and the latter, os the lower part near the root; for i
this reason, that the tibiae dextrae, being smaller, might produce a ξ
sharp, shrill sound; and the tibiae sinistrae a grave, bass sound, since ξ

the hollow of the reed is widest near the root. See Varro, R. R. i. Δ
2. 16. Resides, tlre left-handed fiutes had more stops than the right-

handed. In early times the former had two stops, and the latter but ν
one. See Varro, as cited by‘Servius on Virg. AEn. xi. 618. These ξ
flutes were also denominated, according to· their combination in ᾗ
playing, Phrygian, Lydian and Tyrian, or‘ Sarrane fi-utes, adapted to 3
the three ancient measures of music, the Phrygian, the sharp Lyffian, ἒ
and the grave Dorio. A right-handed and a left-handed fiute played 4
at the same time (for the choraules, or minstrel, always—used two) j·
were called Phrygiam, or tibiae impares, as *being of unequal tub'es, and ᾖ
differing in the number of stops. Two right-handed fiutes, tibia dex· Ξ
troe, or tibiae pares dextra being of equal size, and having an equal ι,
number of stops, were called Lydian. Two left-handed flutes, tibiae :
pares sinistrae, being also of equa] size, and having an equal number ,1
of stops, were named Tyriam or Sarrane fiutes. From this itis plain ξ
the Phrygian was a medium between the Lydian and Dorio measure& 3
Donatus has led almost all ,the commentators into error as to the tone

of these flutes, by saying, The right-handed, or Lydian, by ‘their grave 1
tone, announced the serious style of the comedy: the left-handedg or ξ
Tyrian, by their light, sharp sound, denoted the vivacity· of the piene. l

EST TOTA GRAECA. All the comedies of Terence have been taken
from Greek originals. But this is not the meaning here. Tota

all Grecian. Besides, the scene is laid at Athensr Greek comedies
