INscmPTIO. “ The Inscription,'' otherwise called Titulus by the
Romans, and by the Greeks Διδασκαλία, “ Instruction,’' was, as we
are informed by the Greek Scholiasts‚ always prefixed to such dramatic
pieces as were exhibited at the celebration of some remarkable fes-
tival. The object, therefore, of the inscription, was to inform the
reader when, or on what occasion, and under what magistrates, the
play had been performed; whether it was favourably received, or not,
with other circumstances.

Ac‘rA Lums Mne. “ Aeted at the Megalensian games.'' The
Ludi Megalensia, or more properly Megalesia, Μεγαλήσια, (see Tacit.
Arm. iii. 6,) were instituted by the Phrygians in honour of Cybele,
called by the Greeks Μεγάλη Μήτηρ, and by the Romans, Dea Magna.
Tbey were introduced at Rome during the second Punic war, when the
statue of the goddess was brought, with great pomp, from the Mega-
lesian temple near Pessinus to Rome, by Scipio Nasica. The cele-
bration of these games commenced on the day before the Ides of
April, 'according to Livy, xxix. 14, but according to Ovid, Fast. iv. 179,
on the day before the Nones of April. It is worthy of remark, that
the Romans always said Ludi Megalensia, or Megalesia, never Ludi
Megalenses. Wherever the latter is found, the passage has been cor-
rupted. See Cybele in Lempriere’s Classical Dictionary.

M. meo ET Μ’. GLABmoNE. These purchased the Andrian, and
caused it to be performed at their own expense. Who the former was
is not known. The latter appears to be M’.Aeilius Glabrio Balbus,
who Α. υ, c. 571 dedicated a temple to Piety in the Herb—market.
See Livy, xl. 34. The praenomen of the Acilian family was Manius,
>not Marcus. See Drakenborch on Livy, xxx. 40, ξ 9. Wherefore
Μ’. here, and not Μ., is the true reading.

AEmmnus CURULIBUS. AEdiles were named a cura aedium, as
having the care of buildings. They were first created Α. υ. e. 260,
to assist the tribunes of the Commons. The Curule AEdiles were at
first elected Α. u. c· 387, from among the patrician youth, (Liv. vi. 42 ;
vii. 1,) and afterwards from the plebeians. This was their first step to
higher honours. (See Cic. Leg. iii. 3.) It belonged to the Curule
AEdiles to exhibit public games, which they sometimes did at pro-

digious expense, to gain the favour of the people. ι
’ EGERUNT. Lucius Ambivius Turpio and L. Atilius Praenestinus
were the managers of two companies of performers, who acted this
play either conjointly, or at different periods. They were themselves
the principal actors, as we learn from Donatus’s commentary on the

Phormio.
