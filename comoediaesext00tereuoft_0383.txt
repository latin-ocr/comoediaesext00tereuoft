black bread from yesterday's stale broth ;'’ or “ with stale broth.” Ex
is frequently used for cum in ancient medical prescriptionS. Thus in
Celsus, iii. 19. intritum ex vino. Some say exjure maceratum. Panem
atrum. The Greeks call this μέλανα ἄρτον. Donatus and others in-
terpret atrum by mucidum, “mouldy.'’-— Vorent. This is opposed to
liguriunt.—- 18. Saluti est. “ Is conducive of safety.'’ So est laudi,
est honori, &a — 19. Ego pol te, διο. [Pythias behind, and to herseif:]
“ Ι will certainly be revenged‚” &c. —- Pro istis dictis, &c. That is,
according to your deserts. Comp. Hec. ii. 1. 123 Sall. Cat. c. 51. -ι-
20. Nos illuseris. Comp. Heaut. iv. 4. 19; Phorm. ν. 7. 22.

21. Pro Deum fidem, Sto. [Pythias aloud to herself, coming sarward]
Terence is wonderfully happy in the conduct of the play, by contriving
that Pythias should always retain the same animosity against Parmeno,
and that Parmeno, by all he says, should still more provoke Pythias3
for this is what leads to the unravelling of the plot. These masterly
strokes, says Donatus, are designed for the learned and skilled in

criticism; the rest for the common herd of spectatorS.— 22. Quid ’

est ? Pythias resolved to be revenged of Parmeno, for the trick he had
played them, contrives to appear surprised, and under great concern
for what was doing within. This naturally startles Parmeno, and

” makes him impatient to know what is the matter. Pythias, upon
this, devises a story on purpose to frighten him, and does it so effec-
tually, that in his fear, not knowing what to do better, -he resolves to
discover all to the old man, in which Pythias encourages him, because
her resentment is not yet over, and she wishes to torment him still
further. — 23. Miseret me. [Stin aloud to Ῐιενεεζῖι] ltaque utne vide-
rem, &c. Constr. Itaque misera effugi hue faras, ut ne viderem exempla
indigna, quoe dieunt esse futura in eum. Comp. Phorm. iv. 4. 7. — 24.
Exempla indigna. ‘⁴ Dreadful punishment.” -— In eum. Facere erem-
plum in aliquem signifies the same as sumere grave supplicium de aliquo,
“to punish a person severely‚’' so as to make his case an example to
others. Comp. v. 6. 21 ; Caes. B. G. i. 31.— Quae illaec turba est ,⁹
Comp. Andr. iv. 4. 6, where Davus conducts himself in a manner
similar to that of Pythias here—Quid istuc, Pythias ‚⁹ [Going up to
hen] — 27. Perdidisti istum. Comp. Adesph. i. 1. 36.

30. Eam civem esse? This was an aggravation of Chaerea’s crime.—
Fratrem ei. Ei 'for ejus. —31. Sic inventa ’st. The verb invenire is
osten used with respect to the recovery of a lost child. Comp. Heaut.
v. 2. 36. - 32. Frater violentissimus. Aposiopesis. — 35. Quod moechis
solet. Comp. Juvenal, x. 317 ; Plaut. Poen. iv. 2. 40 3 Hor. Sat. i.
2. 45. -·- 37. Quid ita tantum Γ “ And why so monstrous 2 ” -—- An non
hoc maxumum ’st. “ Is not this most monstrous ? ’'- —- 39. Nescio.
This is artful enough in Pythias, who knew that Parmeno had reason
for what he said, and therefore does not amuse herself in supposing
'the equity of the thing, which would at once have made Parmeno
suspect the truth of what she said. She is content with giving him a
bare account of the thing itself, without meddling with the reasons for
or against it, which it did not at all concern her to know. —40. Edico.
This is more forcible than dieo, and is osten used in threatening.›—41.
Obsecro an is est? [In an insulting tone :] “And prithee is he the
person?’' Comp. Phorm. v. 7. 52. —42. Atque adeo. “ And therefore.”
·—- Vide, διο. “ Have a care what you are about, lest you do him no
good, and perish yourself.”—43. Hoc. This is redundant. —44. A
