of this comedy‚ and his behaviour is in many respectu worthy of imi-
tation. But his conduct in conniving at the irregularities of Ctesipho,
and even assisting him to support them, is certainly reprehensible.
Colman supposes the poet threw this shade over the virtues of Micio,
on purpose to show that mildness and good humour might be carried
to an excess. —Eccum,- adest. [Demea seeing his brathea] - 7. Gor-

an excuse : hence he affects the greater air of confidence, and, finding .
