’ exornatum dabo, adeo perum. “ I will so handle him, so curry him2”
l Exornare aliquem is put by antiphrasis for foedare verberibus. We say,
“ I’ll so trim him.” Comp. Adelph. ii. 1. 22. Pectere for flagris
caedere. ——[Exz·t Menedemus] The departure of Menedemus here ie
very abrupt‚ seeming to be in the midst of a conversation, and his
re- entrance with Clitipho, already supposed to be apprised of what had
passed between the two old gentlemen, is equally precipitate. Menage
imagines that some verses are lost here. Madame Dacier strains hard
to defend the poet3 and fills up the void of time by her old expedient
of making the audience wait to see Chremes walk impatiently to and
fro, till a sufficient time is elapsed for Menedemus to have given Clitipho
a summary account of the cause of his father’ s anger. The truth‘ ιε,
that a too strict observance of unity of place will necessarily produce
such absurdities· 3 and there are several other instances of the like
nature in Terence—79. Deridieulo. “ Very ridiculous.'' The prepo-
sition de in composition sometimes has the signification of valde.—
ᾗ Vidua.» mulieri. “To a weak, desenceless woman.” —— 81. Quae ἔτι me
⁴ feeit. These words are scanned with the first verse of the next scene.

 

ACT V. Senam ΙΙ.

Chremes severely chides his son on account of his mistress· and?
this he does with a design of drawing him from his evil course, that he
may cast off Bacchis, and marry. This scene, moreover, contains 'the
cunning device of Syrus, by which the catastrophe of the 'sable‘ ιε muel:
hast ened. -

fifth, are Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic. The forty-seventh andi
forty- cighth are Tetrameter Iambics Catalectic The remainder are*³

has given a notable example, how much more prevalent reason, urged
with a fatherly concern, is than passion and vehemence. Chemee
