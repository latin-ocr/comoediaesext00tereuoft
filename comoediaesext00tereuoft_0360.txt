322 EUNUCHUS.

iv. 3. 16. This formula is borrowed from the Greek, αὐτὸ δείξει. See
Valcken. on Eurip. Pkoeniss. 626.—17. Procede tu huc. [Parmeno to a
blaclc girl, who enters :] “ Stand you forward this way!'’——18. Ex
AEthiopia. [Addressz'ng Thais :] “ This girl comes all the way from
AEthiopia.'' This was what Thais had earnestly wanted, a girl from
AEthiopia, i. 2. 85. Usque expresses the distance she came, which
was no small addition to the value of the gift. — Hic sunt tres minae.
‘⁴ These are worth three minae.’' Three minae are equa] to 239. 13³. 9d.
See note on Andr. v. 4. 48. - 19. Accede huc. [Enter Chaerea in the
Eunuch’s dress] — Hem Eunuchum tibi. [Addressz'ng Thais ι] “ Here
is an eunuch for you.'’ — 20. Quam liberali facie, &c. “ How liberal his
air, and in the bloom of youth.’' Comp. Andr. i. 1. 11 ; i. 1. 45. —21.
Ita me Di ament, honestus est. “ Now, as I live, he is handsome.”
Comp. Andr. i. 1. 96. —- Quid tu ais ? Parmeno exults in the praise of
Thais, and takes this opportunity of insulting Gnatho. -— 22. Numquid
habes, &c. “Have you discovered any thing in him to lavish your
scorn on? '’ Comp. Andr. iii. 2. 18. - Autem. Comp. Heaut. ii. 3. 10.
— 23. Tacent: satis laudant. “They are dumb! praise sufficient! ”
So cic. Catil. i. 8, dum tacent, clamant. Comp. pro Sext. c. 18.
Silence is a kind of confession and concession‚ especially when an
adversary puts a question. —Fac periclum in literis. ‘⁴ Try him in
literature.” Aristot. Polit. viii. 2. Ἔστι δὲ τέτταρα σχεδὸν, ἃ παιδεύειν
εἰώθασι, γράμματα, καὶ γυμναστικὴν, καὶ μουσικὴν, τέταρτον ἔνιοιγρωφικήν.
Comp. Cic. Orat. iii. 34 ; Nepos, Att. c. 1. - 24. Liberum. The
whole emphasis in pronouncing this sentence lies upon this word,
which discovers Chaerea to have accomplishments above his rank, who,
though he appeared to be no more than a slave, yet was equally skilled
in those polite arts, as if he had been born and educated a citizen. It
was the practice sometimes among the ancients to educate slaves with
care, either that they might sell for the greater price, or be the more
serviceable to their masters. See Hor. Epist. ii. 2. 6.

25. Solertem dabo. “ I will warrant him accomplished.” One
might be almost tempted to imagine that Shakespeare had the Eunuclz
of Terence in his eye, when he penned the following passage concern-
ing the disguise of Viola :

“ Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
{32 ἳξὲιὶῗὲξῗρεῗηῗέἧέῗὸρέἧί Ξὲῗέἒ ἳίἳὲῗῗιιω
Thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him :
It may be worth thy pains ς for 1 can sing,
And speak to him in many sorts of music ;

Triat will allow me very worth his service.”
Twelftlz Niqht. Act Ι. Sc. 2.

26. Ego illum Eunuchum, διο, [Thraso, in an under voice, to his para-
site.]—30. Quod quidam facit. [Parmeno says this with a significant
glane-e towards Thrasa] — 32. Sat habet. “ He is satisfied.'' Comp.
Caes. Β. G. iii. 46; Nepos, Epam. c. 8. ; Livy, V. 21. —·33. Apparet,
διο. The captain draws this conjecture from the compliment which
Parmeno had just made to Thais ς it seemed every way so hmnble and
submissive. Thraso fancied that a man of fortune, who could make
presents of value to his mistress, would never behave in that respeetful
manner 3 for riches are apt to make the owner haughty and overbearing.
This was what the captain meant; but Gnatho, the more to mortify
Parmeno, takes it in another sense. -- 34. Nam hercle, διο. Supply
