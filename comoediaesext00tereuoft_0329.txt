Aer v. ,somn-2 VI. 291

An evil report circulates more speedily than a good one. —- Quod sim
ego nactus mali. “ The misfortune Ι met with.'’ Nancisci, adipisci, ἶ
’ potiri, are said as well of evils as of advantages. Comp. Phorm. iii. 1. ”
53 iii. 3. 103 Nepos Att. c. 21 3 Gell. i. 2. 4. — 5. Factum bene ,Ι
“ Ο, happy chance !” Comp. i. 1. 78. - Hem Ι [Charinus listening,]
‘⁴ How is that ‘3⁹’ — 6. Pater amicus summus nobis. “ Her father is our
greatest friend.” - Narras probe. “ Charming news !''

7. Num ille somniat, διο. [Charinus listening.] We are very apt to
dream of things that have before much engaged our thoughts. Comp.
Luer. iv. 959. From this passage of Terence, virgil seems to have
got the idea of the beautiful line : Credimus Ρ Αη qui amant ipsi sibi
smniafingunt? Ecl. viii. 108. —- 8. Tum de puero. Supply quid fiet.
Comp. ii. 3. 26. — 9. Solus es, διο. These words intimate the greatest
happiness. Comp. Phorm. v. 6. 14. Bentley and Perlet cite here a
Greek proverb from Menander-z ‘Ov οἱ Θεοὶ φιλοῦσιν ἀποθνήσκει νέος.
- 10. Colloquar. [Charinus comes sarward.] -- 12. Tuus est. ‘⁴ Is
your friend.'’ Comp. Eun. ii. 2. 393 Ovid, Epist. iii. 803 Trist. v. 4. 23;
Cic. ad Q. Fr. ii. 1. - 13. Adeo. “ At this time.’' — Illum. Chremes,
who had gone with Crito into the house of Glycerium. — 15. Auferant. ³.
Abducere is the word usual in this case. But the poet uses the verb
auferre, because Glycerium is now supposed to be confined to her bed. ἒ
- Quid cessas ‚9 [Exeunt Pamphilus and Charinus] — 16. Ne exspeo- ⁴
tetis. [Davus turns and addresses the audient-a] — Plaudite. We learn
from Horace, (Epist. ad Pis. 155‚) that all the tragedies and comedies
performed at Rome, ended in this manner ι Donec Cantor vos PLAum'rr:
dicat. Who the Cantor was, is a matter of dispute. Some think it was
a single actor, some suppose it to have been the whole chorus. Before
'the word Plaudite in all the old MSS. is an Ω. Some assert, that as it ¹
is the last letter of the Greek alphabet, it merely signifies finis ‚· others,
that it stands for Ὠιδὸς, Cantor. Bentley says it is a corruption of ca.
for Cantor, denoting that the word Plaudite was said by him.

After Plaudite, in all the old copies of Terence, are these two words:
CALLIOPIUS nael-:nsur ; signifying, “ I Calliopius have revised this
eomedy.” And this, says Madame Dacier‚ proceeds from the custom j
of the old erities, who carefully revised all MSS. ; and when they had η
reas}¹ and gorrected any work, certified the same, by placing their names
at t e en of it.
