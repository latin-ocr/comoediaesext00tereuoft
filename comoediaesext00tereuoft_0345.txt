is still continued here. The parasite advances‚ and is all the way
talking to himself and applauding his own ingenuity‚ in comparison
with that of many others of the like condition with himself. After some·
time, he observes Parmeno standing before the door of Thais, and is
pleased to think that he had the air of one who expected to meet with
an indifferent reception. He goes up to him with a design of
insulting him, and having a little diversion at his expense3 which pro-
duces a very smart conversation between them.

Of this scene, verses 1—23 are Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic;
the remainder are Tetrameter Iambics Catalectic.

1. Di immortales ! &c. ‘⁴ Good heavens 1 how much one man excels
another! What difference 'twixt a wise man and a fool !” The poet
artfissly conveys into this speech of the parasite, several fine strokes of
satire against the manner of his own age. A man of modesty‚ who
cannot prevail upon himself 'to stoop to any meanness‚ is represented
as a fool, and left to languish in poverty. But a rogue, who will stick
at no baseness to accomplish his ends, is treated as a man of under-
standing, a man of ingenuity and address. See Horace's sixth Satire
of the second book. — Stulte intelligens quid interest ‚⁹ The same con-
struction occurs in the Adelph. i. 1. 51, hoc pater ac dominus interest ;
and in Gell. iii. 14, quid dimidium dimidiato intersit. See Perizon‚ on
Sanct. Minerv. iii. 3. -- 2. Hoc adeo ex hac re venit, διο. “ Now this
reflection came into my mind from what has just happened.’' By hac
re is meant his adventure with his old countryman.——3. Adveniens.
For cum advenissem. This the Greeks express more clearly by their
participles; and the Latins by deponent verbs. Comp. ii. 3. 31 ;
Adelph. i. 2. 12; Phorm. v. 1. 31. See Sanct. Min. i. 15. —Mei loci·
atque ordinis. ‘⁴ Of my own condition and rank.” Locus means a
man's ‘⁴ station” in life. Comp. Sall. Cat. c. 23; Cic. de Amic. c. 2.
ordo is taken in the same sense in Plaut. Aul. ii. 2. 55. - Hinc. An
Athenian. Comp. Andr. v. i. 14. —4. Haud impurum, διο. “ No
sordid knave 3 but one who, like myself, had spent by guzzling his
whole estate.” Men of liberal education frequented the baths scr clean-
liness ‚· but the sordid and avaricious did not. Impurus occurs in the
same sense. Heaut. iv. 1. 16. Ligur-ire signifies ‘⁴ to pick and choose
at a feast, and eat delicately.'’ Comp. v. 4. 14. Abligurire‚ ‘⁴ to spend
riotously in eating and drinking.” Comp. Cic. Cat. ii. 5. -- 5. Senium.
“ Tattered and shabby.'’ sentus is properly applied to a field, or place
uneultivated and overgrown with thorns. Comp. Virg. AEn. vi. 462.
—Pannis annisque obsitum. ‘⁴ Beset with rags and years.'’ Pannus
properly signifies ‘⁴ a patch of cloth.” Comp. Heaut. ii. 3. 53 ; Sueton.
Calig. c. 35. A field is said to beobsitus which is covered with weeds
and filth. obsitus aevo occurs in Virg. AEn. viii. 307. Comp. Livy, i.
14 3 Lucan, v. 627. — 6. Quid istuc ornati est ? ‘⁴ What dress is this 2¹⁹
ornati, an archaism for ornatus. —- Quoniam miser. This is the reply of
the poverty—struck spendthrift. — 7. Noti. In an active sense sor qui
’ me norunt, “my acquaintances.” Comp. Cic. Verr. i. 7; Phaedr. i.
11 ς Petron. c. 112. —- 8. Prae me. ⁴⁴ In comparison with myself.”

9. Itan' parasti te. ‘⁴ Have you armed yourself with no better con-
trivance than,’' Sco. Comp. Hec. i. 1. 11. — 10. Simul consilium cum
re amisti? “ What! have you lost your sense with your estate ?” This,
ns Donatus observes, is an interrogation of one blaming and chiding,
and does not require an answer. The parasite thinks his friend's plea
