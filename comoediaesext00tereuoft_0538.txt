matris, &c. constr. Pietas mihi suadet, me sequi potius commodum
matris : “Duty obliges me to regardss’ &c. Comp iii. 4. 33.
It is preferable to make me the accusative before sequi.- although
suadeo and persuadeo are sometimes construed with an accusative.
Comp. Phaedr. i. 15. 6. Commodum sequi, is explained by vs. 45. Comp. ,

Dacier observes, that the poet has framed this answer of Laches with
great judgment, so as not to be wanting in a due return to the dutiful
declaration of his son, nor contradict what he had so earnestly set his
mind upon. He does not entirely commend his son’s speech, nor does,
he say that he had done him a great pleasure, for sear of encouraging
him in the resolution he has taken, of parting from his wife: he con-
tents himself with saying‚ he is not displeased with a speech wherein
he has expressed so high a regard for his parents. To translate the
passage thus, “ You do me a great pleasure,’' would entirely destroy
its beauty and justness. —- 33. Cum res postputasse, διο. Comp. Adelph.

Andr. i. 1. 12. This verb is often taken in a bad sense3 as mereor and

that I will go cringing to him. '²’ — 52. Sln alio est animo. “ But if he
will not, let him refund her portion, and be off.” According to the
Roman law, when a marriage was dissolved, except in the case of
adultery, the wife' s father had a right to demand her portion back3 and
there is no doubt that this was the custom also among the Greeks,
as may be gathered from Apuleius, Apol. p. 547. ed. Delph. See Petit.
