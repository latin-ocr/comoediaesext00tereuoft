ACT ΙΙΙ. ScENE III.

Chremes, aster parting srom Syrus in the last scene, goes in; and
coming unexpectedlysvpon Clitipho, finds him with Bacchis, whom he
still believes to be Clinia’s mistress. Whereupon he calls him aside,
and expostulates with him. Syrus, concerned for himself, and the

roject he is upon the point of executing, joins with the old man in
his reproofs, and both at last agree that Clitipho shall withdraw for some
time, and not disturb the lovers.

shows that, even amongst the most intimate friends, a proper caution

and reserve ought not to be forgotten. Our actions will not appear in v

the same light to others as to ourselves. Our passions sometimes blind

ffifling, of the greatest importance to us. It is for this reason that
a man of prudence will not be apt to expose all his weaknesses and
foibles, even to those from whom he expects the greatest indulgence;
because, however excusable they may appear to himself, he knows
that it would be vain to hope for the same allowance from those who
are not equally interested. -— The final syllable of hodie in this verse,
