ACT V. ScENss VIII.

When the old man went to Thais to prevent the mischief which he
fancied threatened his son, he was there made acquainted with every
thing ; and finding the young lady a citizen of family, and Chaerea
distractedly in love with her, consented to the marriage. Chaerea
comes out with great exclamations of joy. Parmeno, who expected
the severest treatment, wonders to hear himself addressed as one who
had done him the greatest good offices. Being at lastinformed of
what had happened, he is sent to give Phaedria an account of the good
news. In the conclusion, Phaedria, infor-med of all that had passed,
comes to look for his brother, and, spying the captain, charges him
never to approach the street. At last, by the cunning insinuatione of
Gnatho, he is received Into their society, and all ends happily.

Verses 1 and 20—64, are Tetrameter Trochaics Catalectic; verses
2—19, Tetrameter Iambics Acatalectic.
