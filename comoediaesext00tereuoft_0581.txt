melius seceris. ‘⁴ What, yourself? you had better not.” Demipho,{
(vss. 72, 73,) had threatened that he would not rest till he affected a
legal separation between his son and Phanium: and (vs. 78,) he
threatens to turn them both out of his house. Here Phormio asks
him jeeringly, if he did not intend to wait for the decision of the
judges, but take the law into his own hands. The general reading is
tute idem melius feceris. Patrick translates it: “You will be better
advised ;’' with this note: Commentators differ greatly as to the
meaning of these words: some explain them —-“You will scarcely
venture to put your threats into execution.'’ Others, “ You will think
better of it.” It may perhaps have been a common form of speech,
where threats were despised as impotent. Such is that of Davus in
the Andria : bona verba quoeso. Thus Patrick.——Donatus and Eugraphius
say, “ You will do better by leaving the house to themselves ;'' con·
