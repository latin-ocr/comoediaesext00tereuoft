ACT ΙΙΙ. Seme II.

syrus had succeeded so well in making Bacchis pass for ‘Clinia's
mistress, that she had been at Chremes’ house all night; nor had the
old man any suspicion of their project. Here, then, was one point
gained3 but still there was another thing wanting to make every one
easy and contented. Syrus had undertaken to obtain ten minae for
Bacchis. She herself began to be impatient that she did not receive
it, and Clitipho was perpetually teazing him with importunities to fall
upon some expedient to procure it. Syrus, therefore, seeing it cannot
be deferred any longer, is here brought upon the stage, datermined to
make some attempt. Chremes, who, as we have seen before, suspected
that there was some project on foot against Menedemus, and was
resolved to encourage it, overhearing what Syrus says, applies it imme-
diately to that notion‚ and never once imagines that he himself is so
nearly concerned. This makes way for a conversation, managed with
great art and address on both sides, and full of entertainment to the
render, who is acquainted with their different views.

This scene consists of Trimeter Iambics.
