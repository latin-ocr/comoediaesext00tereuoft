LIFE OF TERENCE.

 

To Africa we are indebted for the celebrated Publius Terentius ; and
the magnificent city of Carthage is generally assigned as his birth-
place. Of his parentage nothing whatever is known3 and the age in
which he lived was, probably, as ignorant on this point as the present;
for we can scarcely suppose that the haughty and selfish Roman would
stoop to make inquiries after the progenitors of a slave, however
talented. It would seem that his parents were of the lower station in
life ι had their rank entitled them to distinction in their native country,
the poet himself would, perhaps, have lest us some memorial of them.
Even his African name is buried in oblivion.

Terence was born in the year of Rome 560, which corresponds with
the year 193 before Christ. In very early life he became the captive
of some one’s bow and spear, by whom, or at least through whose
meanS, he was transferred to Rome as a slave. Some writers are dis-
posed to make a matter of wonder how he could become a slave to a
Roman, since so little traffic existed between Rome and Carthage at
tha} period; and moreover, that the two cities were then at peace with
each other. But we know from ancient historiam, that the Cartha-
ginians were almost continually embroiled in wars with some one or
other of the African nations around them ; and that they had constant
intercommunication with Sicily. Hence the transition of the produc-
tions of the respective countries is obvious ; for with Sicily the Romans
also had commercial intercourse, and thus she became the interposit of
both.

However, it was the lot of our author, in his tender yearS‚ to be one
among the slaves of Terentius Lucanus, a Roman Senator, either by
means of purchase, capture, or gist; and the strongest probability is in
favour of his acquisition by purchase. In this, Fortune showed herself

eminently auspicious to him; for, by entrusting him to so indulgent ¹

and discriminating a master, she made amends for her cruelty in de-
priving him of his freedom—man’s noblest birth-right. But to some
y genereus spirits no debasement of position is prejudicia13 and to the
γ’ servile condition of our poet is to be attributed the development of
’ those histrionic talents, which subsequently elevated him to so distin-
guished a rank· 111 class'ical literature.

being the custom of the Romans, on the enfranchisement of their slaves:
