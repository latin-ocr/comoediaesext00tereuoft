26. Nos abalienavit. ‘⁴ He cut us off from the family.” Alienus, (v.
4. 6‚) ,signifies “a stranger‚” one who does not belong to the family.
See the Commentators in Livy, xli. 8. -— 27. Adeon' rem rediisse. “ Is it
come to this then? ” - Perielum etiam a fame. Comp. Hec. v. 1. 10.
The preposition is omitted in some editions : in which case fame is an
obsolete genitive for samis. Comp. Aul. Gell. ix. 14.—28. Modo
liceat vivere, est spes. “ So we do but live, there is hope.'’ Comp.
Cic. Att. ix. 6. — 30. Ibi nunc sum. “ I am attending to that nOW.”

quaero. — 32. Non esse horum te. ‘⁴ That you are not their son.''-— Qui
istuc? “How do you imagine that? ''— 33. In mentem est. We
have the same construction in Adelph. iv. 1. 12, and frequently in
Plautus. Comp. Aul. Gell. i. 7. Some unnecessarily read mente:
others omit est.-——35. Te indulgebant. Te here is an archaism 'for
tibi. Comp. Eun. ii. 1. 16. — 36. Inventa. Terence is fond of repe-
titions. Comp. i. 2. 32; Hee. ii. 1. 45. —- Inventa causa. Comp.
Andr. ii. 3. 7.

38. Matres omnes, διο. Menander ε Ἐστι δὲ μήτηρ φιλότεκνος
μᾶλλον πατρός. —- 39. Paterna injuria. An injury which a father com-
mits against his own child. — 40. Id non fit. ‘⁶ This your mother does
not do.'' — 41. Suspicionem. “ Whether you are their son, or not.'’ —
Rem profer palam. “ Declare your thoughts openly.'’ Comp. Adesph.
iii. 2. 41. - 43. Aut. Supply si est verum. — Faciam. [ExitCla'tipho.]
—Sat recte, &c. [Syrus alone :] “This thought came very luckily
into my mind.''

We are to admire Syrus’s prudence and address in the present case.
His whole aim is to make up Clitipho's peace, and bring his father to
better temper. He could think of nothing more likely to effect this,

q than by making Clitipho feign that he did not believe himself to be

Chremes’ son. But as there is a great difference between the beha—
viour of one who acts from the real persuasion of a thing, and one
who knows that he uses it only as a pretence; Syrus knew the man
too well to trust him with the secret, and, therefore, begins by
making him the first dupe. By this two good ends were answered at
once. Chremes, alarmed at his son’s entertaining such a notion,
would the sooner relent; and especially the mother would be startled,
and redouble her importunities pwijth her husband to cancel what he
had done. And the young man himself too, thus reduced to the brink
of despair, would be the readier to comply with whatever his father
might require as the condition of his reconciliation. —Recta Comp.

διο. WVhen quam and a superlative precede, they are sometimes fol-

expression. — 45. Patris pacem in leges, &c. “Will obtain his father’ Β
